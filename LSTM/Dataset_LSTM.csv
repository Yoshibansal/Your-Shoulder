2,"Ex Wife Threatening SuicideRecently I left my wife for good because she has cheated on me twice and lied to me so much that I have decided to refuse to go back to her. As of a few days ago, she began threatening suicide. I have tirelessly spent these paat few days talking her out of it and she keeps hesitating because she wants to believe I'll come back. I know a lot of people will threaten this in order to get their way, but what happens if she really does? What do I do and how am I supposed to handle her death on my hands? I still love my wife but I cannot deal with getting cheated on again and constantly feeling insecure. I'm worried today may be the day she does it and I hope so much it doesn't happen.",depressed

9,"Iâ€™m so lostHello, my name is Adam (16) and Iâ€™ve been struggling for years and Iâ€™m afraid. Through these past years thoughts of suicide, fear, anxiety Iâ€™m so close to my limit . Iâ€™ve been quiet for so long and Iâ€™m too scared to come out to my family about these feelings. About 3 years ago losing my aunt triggered it all. Everyday feeling hopeless , lost, guilty, and remorseful over her and all the things Iâ€™ve done in my life,but thoughts like these with the little Iâ€™ve experienced in life? Only time Iâ€™ve revealed these feelings to my family is when I broke down where they saw my cuts. Watching them get so worried over something I portrayed as an average day made me feel absolutely dreadful. They later found out I was an attempt survivor from attempt OD(overdose from pills) and attempt hanging. All that happened was a blackout from the pills and I never went through with the noose because Iâ€™m still so afraid. During my first therapy I was diagnosed with severe depression, social anxiety, and a eating disorder.
 I was later transferred to a fucken group therapy for some reason which made me feel more anxious. Eventually before my last session with a 1 on 1 therapy she showed me my results from a daily check up on my feelings(which was a 2 - step survey for me and my mom/dad )
 Come to find out as Iâ€™ve been putting feeling horrible and afraid/anxious everyday , my mom has been doing Iâ€™ve been doing absolutely amazing with me described as â€œhappiest sheâ€™s ever seen me, therapy has helped himâ€ 
 I eventually was put on Sertaline (anti anxiety or anti depression Iâ€™m sorry I forgot) but I never finished my first prescription nor ever found the right type of anti depressant because my mom thought I only wanted the drugs so she took me off my recommended pill schedule after ~3 week and stopped me from taking them. All this time Iâ€™ve been feeling worse afraid of the damage/ worry Iâ€™ve caused them even more. 
 Now here with everything going on, Iâ€™m as afraid as Iâ€™ve ever been . Iâ€™ve relapsed on cutting and have developed severe insomnia . Day after day feeling more hopeless, worthless questioning why am I still here? Whatâ€™s my motivation to move out of bed and keep going? I ask these to myself nearly every night almost having a break down everytime. 
 Please Please Please someone.. anyone help me.
 Iâ€™m so scared I might do something drastic, Iâ€™ve been shaped by fear and anxiety. Idk what to do anymore",suicide
11,"Honetly idkI dont know what im even doing here. I just feel like there is nothing and nowhere for me. All i can feel is either nothing or unbearably sad. Im ignoring friends every opitunity i can. I feel like im loosing my girlfriend. I only hurt everyone i talk too and i dont cause anything good. Im behind on my education, i feel alone but for the first time its not a feeling ive enjoyed. I have no hopes or dreams. I care about nothing, not family, not friends, not even my girlfriend (i still love her, its complicated and i dont have the words to describe it). 
 
 I would do something to end myself but i know im not strong and brave enough to do it, and knowing im that weak makes me sadder. The only thing i can do is push away all emotion and be empty, because as bad as it is im used to it, its my way of being normal. 
 
 I dont understand how people have hopes or dreams, and i mentioned how bad i was feeling to my girlfriend but she just got scared i would die so i havnt brought it up again. But in that talk i realised i cant even comprehend my life having meaning to anyone.
 
 I know this is just me rambling and i will probably regret posting this as ill think im taking the place of someone having a worse time with a gun to their head. I encoage all people who see this to help them instead of me. Ill probably suvive, they might not. Plus my life is meaningless and my future bleak, while they could cure cancer or something useful.

 But, I did. I did something stupid out of impulse. I burned myself. I REALLY need help with an excuse as the father of my daughter knows my history (we were together 12 years.)

 Should I say I touched something under the hood while the car was still hot? I have 3 almost in a curved like pattern the first on forearm then down a little then on the side of my wrist. They are about an inch long, kind of wide and a little deep. 
 
 I think the car excuse is a good one but I would need to say what I was working on to explain the 3 burns. Maybe that there was a wire smooshed behind the engine and when I went to fix it I touched the engine?

 The I don't feel like I stand out is because of all the others copying a style and if I do that I'd be just another

 Many of my friends say that I look good in grunge style and I kinda agree but it's hard for me to continue that if I can't even stand out from all the ""edgy

32,"Trapped inside a voidDear whoever cares enough to read this, though I doubt there are any that fall under that criteria.
 
 I am trapped inside a void. There is absolutely nothing for me. I go through the monotonous tasks of every-day life with nothing to look forward to, no aspirations whatsoever. The only saving grace I felt like I had, the only thing that made me feel like I was wanted, and accepted me for who I am, was Maren. As absolutely idiotic as it sounds (and sheâ€™s assured me that it is,) talking to her was the one thing I looked forward to every day. It was the one thing that kept me going; knowing that some time throughout the day I would be able to talk to her, even if only briefly before we went to sleep.
 
 She made me feel accepted. She made me feel like I had some kind of worth. She made me feel like I could actually like myself, and be okay with who I was. But most of all, she made me feel loved. Never before have I ever been able to open up to someone so completely. I felt completely at ease when talking with her. Iâ€™ve told her things that no one else in the world knows about me, and she made me feel like she actually cared about them- that she cared about me. We shared many intimate moments that I would never dare have with anyone else. We talked about getting together, being with each other, devising crazy scenarios with how to be together. We talked all the time, nothing could keep us apart. Except for Ty. She helped me through all of the problems I was facing related to my depression over the break-up with Starr. She talked to me whenever I needed her, and she always made me feel better about it. She was my shining star in a pitch-black sky. None of this is any longer, though.
 
 We have slowly drifted apart as she began to realise exactly how I am. I am sure she regrets getting involved with me, and I donâ€™t blame her. I do nothing but hurt her these days. None of it is intentional, but it happens nonetheless. When we first started talking again, I told her about my clingy tendencies and she said she was okay with that. I suppose she thought I was over-exaggerating, but I wasnâ€™t. I need to have interaction in my life. I know it is not fair to the people around me, and I know that it is not what they want, but I cannot be alone in my own thoughts all the time. My thoughts are extremely self-destructive. I need someone to spend time with, someone to talk to to get away from my thoughts. 
 
 For about four months I was legitimately happy. That was probably the only time in my life I have ever actually been legitimately happy. I was finally over Starr, thanks to the help from Maren. I had no stress at all, things were actually looking up, even my migraines were becoming few and far between. I was in love, and I felt loved. If I could go back in time and re-play those four months over and over again, I would without hesitation. That was the best time of my life. I didnâ€™t have people ridiculing me for various reasons beyond my control. I didnâ€™t have to feel like I had to hold all of my feelings inside. I could share them with Maren, and she was incredibly receptive. I didnâ€™t have to lie about who I was, or leave details out. Maren made me feel like I was a good person. I told her about my past, and she seemed genuinely concerned for me. She tried hard to dispel all of the hateful things I have been told about myself. She told me that I was attractive, something I had never been told before, not even by Starr, who I was together with for ten years. I was happy with who I was at that time. Prior to that I had never willingly taken a picture of myself. But with her, we would send each other snapchat pictures, and she made me feel like I wasnâ€™t the hideous person that I thought myself to be. In hindsight, I am sure that she was just being nice to me, and that she did not actually think I was attractive. It was still nice to hear it, though.
 
 I miss those days. I long for them to return, but I know that that will never happen. The same thing has happened with many people before, though none to that extreme. They are fine with me when we first start talking, and eventually they realise how high-maintenance and fucked up I am. That causes them to drift away, until eventually we stop talking altogether, or sometimes they just abruptly cut me out of their lives. That was the case with Starr. The night before she broke up with me she told me that she loved me. In the morning, she told me it was over and a few weeks later told me to never talk to her again. After ten years of being together, she ended it on a whim, and caused me to lose not only my significant other, but also my best friend. The same thing is happening with Maren. I am driving her away, and eventually I will not have a best friend again. I will be completely alone. The last time I was completely alone, right after Starr broke up with me, I didnâ€™t leave my room for two weeks. I didnâ€™t eat a single thing in those two weeks. I laid there in bed, staring at my ceiling in the darkness, constantly in tears, trying to realise where I had gone wrong. I have never cried so much in my life. I have hid my emotions from outside view all of my life, but at that moment I could not contain them any longer. I had absolutely nothing left for me in the world, and that is how I feel again, right now.
 
 It was complete luck that I was actually able to reconnect with Maren again. I have no idea at all how to make friends. She just happened to be online on Facebook when I was feeling at my absolute lowest. I sent her a message with no expectations whatsoever, I was prepared to either be completely ignored, or told to go away. That didnâ€™t happen though. We had a wonderful conversation, reminiscing about our childhood. I donâ€™t remember how the subject got changed to me talking about Starr, but I told her everything, and she seemed like she genuinely cared about it. She stayed up with me until the morning, just talking with me on Facebook. I was in tears for most of that conversation, partly because I was still upset about the breakup, but also because I couldnâ€™t believe that someone actually cared. Especially someone I hadnâ€™t talked to in over a decade. When we started to get close, and revealed our feelings for one another, we joked about how us reconnecting was a â€œred string of fate.â€ I donâ€™t believe in fate, but I also donâ€™t think it was just dumb luck that caused us to reconnect at that moment, when I felt like I had nothing left. The problem lies in the fact that I will never be able to replicate that with anyone else. I am incredibly socially awkward; I cannot make new friends at all. In person I just completely freeze up and get overwhelmed with anxiety. Online, I just have nothing to say. I am a boring person. I have tried to make new friends on various subreddits, /r/r4r, /r/kikpals and the like. I have talked to a few people who seemed nice, but none of them developed into an actual friendship. They all stopped talking to me after one session. I donâ€™t have anything at all to give in a friendship.
 
 After fighting with Maren, and being told that I canâ€™t keep badgering her to hang out with me, when all I asked was that if she was going to be able to talk after she was done watching Game of Thrones with her new boyfriend (who was her ex,) my self-worth is absolutely rock bottom. She has made me realise that I am the problem, that it is my fault my relationships always dissolve. She joined me in blaming Starr for the dissolution of our relationship, but I see now that it was never her fault. I am just completely unlovable. I can never have more than one true friend. I believe this stems from the fact that growing up, I had very few friends, and when I tried to expand and make new friends I got burned very badly, every time. Because of this, I latch on to the one friend I have. I suffocate them. I bother them until they cannot stand it any more, and leave me. I have tried so hard to give her space, and not ask her to hang out with me, or talk to me, but whenever I try, I get extremely depressed. I have spent the past two weeks in extreme depression. I was hoping that by the weekend we would be able to hang out and it would alleviate some of it, but she cancelled our plans in favour of hanging out with someone else. Every time I ask her to do something and she says no, I get a sinking feeling. Mainly because in the four months that I was happy, we did everything together. Any time I asked if she wanted to do something, she was happy to hang out with me. She was happy to talk to me nearly every moment she was awake. I suppose that is only sustainable for so long until someone would get bored of me. I have very little to offer, it was mainly her driving everything, and that must have been exhausting.
 
 I am getting tired of writing, though. I recognize my faults and all of my flaws, but I have no knowledge or motivation to fix them. I have lived with them my entire life, and not a single person has stayed around because of them. I am writing this because I now have zero friends. I am completely alone. No one in the world would even notice if I fell off the face of the Earth, or faded into oblivion.

 Much that once was is lost, for none now live who remember it.
 
 It began with the forging of the Great Rings. Three were given to the Elves, immortal, wisest and fairest of all beings. Seven to the Dwarf-Lords, great miners and craftsmen of the mountain halls. And nine, nine rings were gifted to the race of Men, who above all else desire power. For within these rings was bound the strength and the will to govern each race. But they were all of them deceived, for another ring was made. Deep in the land of Mordor, in the Fires of Mount Doom, the Dark Lord Sauron forged a master ring, and into this ring he poured his cruelty, his malice and his will to dominate all life.
 
 One ring to rule them all.
 
 One by one, the free lands of Middle-Earth fell to the power of the Ring, but there were some who resisted. A last alliance of men and elves marched against the armies of Mordor, and on the very slopes of Mount Doom, they fought for the freedom of Middle-Earth. Victory was near, but the power of the ring could not be undone. It was in this moment, when all hope had faded, that Isildur, son of the king, took up his fatherâ€™s sword.
 
 Sauron, enemy of the free peoples of Middle-Earth, was defeated. The Ring passed to Isildur, who had this one chance to destroy evil forever, but the hearts of men are easily corrupted. And the ring of power has a will of its own. It betrayed Isildur, to his death.
 
 And some things that should not have been forgotten were lost. History became legend. Legend became myth. And for two and a half thousand years, the ring passed out of all knowledge. Until, when chance came, it ensnared another bearer.
 
 It came to the creature Gollum, who took it deep into the tunnels of the Misty Mountains. And there it consumed him. The ring gave to Gollum unnatural long life. For five hundred years it poisoned his mind, and in the gloom of Gollumâ€™s cave, it waited. Darkness crept back into the forests of the world. Rumor grew of a shadow in the East, whispers of a nameless fear, and the Ring of Power perceived its time had come. It abandoned Gollum, but then something happened that the Ring did not intend. It was picked up by the most unlikely creature imaginable: a hobbit, Bilbo Baggins, of the Shire.

107,"Anyone planning suicide in the long-term future?I'm a depressed 22F who is considering suicide, but not soon, but within maybe 4-5 years.
 Why do I want to kill myself?
 It's kind of a long story. But the main reasons are a combination: (Lack of) Economic Stability, Health Problems, Family
 along with a lack of purpose or inherent value of life.
 
 **Economic**:
 
 Growing up was hard and I've had to overcome a lot of adversity (lower-income household, mother dying at
 a young age, being a queer person of color, strict parents, depression etc), like a lot of people here.
 I'm in college currently, but found that although I genuinely love learning and picked a STEM major, college 
 just seems very oppressive. I know it makes me sound like an entitled, first world millenial.
 My parents made me go the flagship state school directly after high school, not allowing me to choose a different school
 or even CC for a few years (I had relatively good grades in high school). I knew from the moment I was on campus
 that I hated it; lack of diversity and friendship, my health was negatively impacted, I didn't have a good sense of direction
 or idea for a major/career and never felt inspired. I thought about transferring, but didn't have the 
 resources or finances (first-generation college student), so I stuck it out though I was depressed. I did well academically
 but since my major/department is kinda shitty (applied math), I'm worried that I won't get a good paying job, unlike
 engineering students. Like had I known earlier, I would have just majored in that instead. I will leave college
 next year with about 25-28K in loans.
 
 **Family**:
 
 Generally, I strongly dislike my family life. My other siblings went to medical school and basically left the house
 as fast as they could. My mom died at a young age, and instead of helping me out as possible with school or becoming
 self-sufficient, my dad remarried and spends his money on his new wife (unemployed) and kids, even though he's pretty old
 and should be focusing on retirement. I haven't come out as queer yet, but worry that my family will disown me because of it.
 (not super religous, but super conservative, strict and family-oriented). My parents are also immigrants so we don't have
 tons of wealthy family here.
 
 **Health**:
 I have a lot of chronic, probably genetically-caused, health diseases since I was young.
 When I was young and in my mid-teens, I was able to take care of them when my parents were employed and supportive.
 After my mom died, my dad didn't bother helping me out that much and without the resources for seeing specialists
 anymore, my health has decreased. It's hard at college too, because I don't have a car, and I didn't always have
 health insurance to be able to see anyone. So my health continues to decrease. These aren't
 life-threatening health issues, but irreverisble for the most part and make me feel insecure and self-conscious.
 
 So because of all this, I find it hard to justify continuing life. I am kind of a nihilist and definitely 
 an atheist with no absolutely no belief in the afterlife. I don't want to kill myself yet, but in 3-4 years,
 when I can be more distant from my family and meticulous in suicide-planning once I'm in the ""real world"".
 I've seen many psychologists over the years, but rarely find them helpful or knowledgeable, and condescending even.
 It seems statistically unlikely that a queer woman of color from a first-generation college student background with severly
 limited family support, chronic health issues, and student loans to be economically secure in like, even 5 years. And it's
 hard to see my straight, white, male friends from more accepting and upper-middle class families succeed in life, when it's a
 constant struggle for me.And even if I can push through and somehow find a way through the misery, what's the point? Why suffer and
 struggle so much in life if I don't really see a reason too? Basically I created this post to see if anyone else agreed
 with me and is truly planning suicide in the future.I'm also fine with talking to people about my choices and/or
 expanding on the reasons above, though I doubt people can change my mind.
 
 TL:DR: Want to wait 3-4 years before committing suicide. Basically I personally see life worth living if
 I'm economically secure, have supportive family and friends, and am generally healthy. However, for a multitude of complex
 reasons, all of the above factors are not really possible or likely for me. I am also a nihilist, atheist and 
 don't see a point to life, other than that society has stigmatized suicide and thinks everybody born should continue living.",depressed

Someone MAYBE has covid so now I can't go to the city and I will miss the first two days of irl schools which would have given me a plan on how this school year starts. Great!

110,"Screenwriting Course Scripts and Characters that commit suicide (and other parts of dealing with depression)I've been a little low lately, so this matters to me. I'm long past the days where every moment feels like breathing underwater, so it only hurts a little.
 
 I wrote the outline for my script a year and a half ago, when I was in the worst throws of my depression and was nearly hospitalized. And now, as I am in the class that comes after that basic course, I have to finish the script. I like how the script has grown and changed, and it certainly has a broader scope than the depression that haunted me. 
 
 But today I had to write the little part where the character considers committing suicide. It was like I was seeing myself doing his actions. There is another character that is the voice of depression, and every line I wrote was the ideas that I had in my head. It was like writing down my thoughts, from the past. Too easy to write, which meant I could zoom past it faster, but I could never watch this script come to life. It would be too traumatic. I couldn't let other people see that too. Especially people who know what its like.
 
 I know it isn't the same, now that I'm much better, but I feel like I could see myself cutting to stop myself from committing suicide, or looking over the edge of a building, sad that I was hesitating and that I wouldn't do it. Confused if that was really what I wanted.
 
 Another complexity. I feel like I've become the expert on suicide, hospitalization, therapy, group therapy, anti-depressants, and depression within my class. Too many scripts don't get it right. It's never as straightforward as they write it. Even now, it's not straightforward; a part of me, very small, wants to kill myself. A larger part of me wants to be off antidepressants, even if it means that I fall back into depression. An even larger part of me is ready to cut myself at a moment's notice, to just stop pain. And now I will talk about the script during class, like opening up too much of a wound. We will see how much it bothers me. I don't think it will too much, but who knows, right?
 
 Someone in my class wasn't clear about what the character was doing (accident or attempt). To me it sounded like a suicide attempt, and if it is, well... I guess I'll have to tell her that there's no realistic way that she would get out of the hospital the same day. Even if it is an accident, someone would be asking her about her intent.
 
 My life keeps getting more and more complex the farther I am from the epicenter of my depression. Not that I don't have depression (getting much closer to stable though).
 
 I know this is long, and I though this isn't entirely related. But I just wanted to show this to people who know what it's like to consider suicide, or know a bit about the ambiguity, treatment, and reactions that follow it.",depressed

 Okay, so I guess the best way to begin this is to just tell you straight up that Iâ€™m gay. This wouldnâ€™t be an issue if I didnâ€™t have strictly conservative parents, I know a lot of people have it worse off than me, but I feel like most of my problems stem from this.
 
 I havenâ€™t been diagnosed as anything really, but I donâ€™t really care because it doesnâ€™t take a fucking expertâ€™s opinion to tell you there is something genuinely fucking wrong with me. Lately Iâ€™ve been feeling more and more suicidal, and have been planning my suicide more and more and how I could enact it with little to no effort whatsoever. And right before the time of this post in fact, Iâ€™ve cut myself for the first time. Very shallow cuts, 7 of them. Worst part of it was trying to get the bleeding to stop, even now. That and Iâ€™ve been feeling like absolute SHIT consistently for 4 months now, so yeah thereâ€™s definitely something wrong.
 
 To further go into detail about the cutting, looking back at it, I snapped and started cutting, going deeper than anything Iâ€™ve tried to cut and with such force and pressure. Iâ€™m glad there was only an exacto knife nearby, if anything else I think I may have bled out. What scares me about this is 1. how I snapped and started cutting myself and how fast I went to cut myself and 2. How the fuck Iâ€™m going to hide the cuts and if someone asks what excuse I could possibly come up with.
 
 At the time of typing this, yesterday during work I was so miserable that I contemplated walking out climbing up a tree, tying my hoodie sleeves on both the tree and my next and just letting myself fall. I obviously didnâ€™t do this, and even if I were to walk out, Iâ€™d probably wouldnâ€™t because I felt like if I did, Iâ€™d just spread my suffering to my family. 
 
 About my family : As I stated previously, theyâ€™re an adamant religious bunch, and they have no tolerance for gays, heresy and mental illness, so I have to act as if I were something I were not around them, and I think the facade is taking a toll on my mind because then I feel like I have no actual personality and that I just have to be fake around people to make them happy at the time. Iâ€™ll be honest, itâ€™s hard sometimes but I feel no sense of â€œselfnessâ€ I have never EVER even gave them a hint that I would ever be gay, I try to make it seem like gay isnâ€™t even a comprehensible subject and that it is something so outlandish it shouldnâ€™t exist. However, recently I have told my mother that I am feeling anxious about everything, stressed over tiny things and that Iâ€™m feeling like absolute shit and Iâ€™ve been considering suicide and she just yells at me and tells me Iâ€™m lazy and that even I couldnâ€™t amount to anything if I gave it all of my willpower, and what hurts more than the words is the expectation being shattered. I just want someone to understand me, and to love me for what I am, and genuinely acknowledge that there is something wrong with me, and that I need help, but it just makes me so fucking sad that itâ€™s never going to happen, I donâ€™t even tell this sort of stuff to my one friend because it just ruins the atmosphere and brings the mood down, so I canâ€™t just do that. I feel like I genuinely have nobody, I feel so isolated and alone. I know there are those who have it so much worse off than me, and I try to rationalize the situation in consideration of the fact, but I canâ€™t help but feeling so fucking bad.
 
 I am scared that Iâ€™m going to kill myself soon, I just want things to stop being shit, Iâ€™ve been feeling like this on and off for almost 5

 For the first time in I think maybe 3 or 4 years I started researching suicide methods. My dad takes anticoagulants for his artificial heart valve, and I figured if I steal some of his medicine and cut myself in the bathtub I can bleed out and die peacefully. I have the growing urge to hurt myself permanently. The only hard part will be leaving a note for my family and a letter for my ex maybe, but I donâ€™t know what I even need to say to him besides sorry. Still, this terrifies me but excites me, I just crave life to be over so often and Iâ€™m getting restless.
 
 No matter what happens in life, I always end up in the same place. I keep fighting but Iâ€™m wondering whoâ€™s battle is this actually? Iâ€™m definitely not fighting for myself anymore. Iâ€™ve officially given up and am just waiting for my dad to come home from a trip so I can see him one last time.",suicide

The past few months have been especially hard for some reason. I have very little money left, no immediate family, one friend I see once a week, and a fiancee who I love but who is also under a great deal of mental and emotional stress (and being around me doesn't make it any better). I have talked to both master's and PhD level therapists this year and it never helps. Talk therapy doesn't fix anything for me. Maybe it's because my bachelor's degree is in psychology but it never helps anything.
 
 The days where I don't think about (bad things) are probably fewer than the ones where I do, and that makes me so sad.
 
 Sometimes I feel like I can't do it anymore, and it disappoints me because I've got a lot going for me on paper (got accepted back to college for a second bachelor's degree recently), but most days it's a struggle just to wake up and go to my job. I feel like I just want to go away and let the world go on without me, and I realize that's a dangerous kind of thinking that I need to nip in the bud before it gets the better of me.
 
 I was drinking a lot this past year but I've been trying to quit for a few weeks too. Not being able to numb myself to the same degree has led to many nights where I don't sleep well, where I get lost in my own thoughts, and where I go to bad places quickly.
 
 I have many hobbies and I have passions, but I have no passion for those passions on my bad days.
 
 I need to do something to fix myself. I don't want to have this constant cloud over me anymore. Any ideas as to what I should do?
 
 I feel like the levels between my coping mechanisms and my overwhelming pervasive depression are very skewed in the direction of the latter.
 
 Thanks for listening anyway, helped to type that out.
 
 **Edit:** To clarify, I am talking about real, actual mental health help - or perhaps medication - not reading self help books, not going for a run, not meditating. I have done all of those things ad nauseum. I do them regularly. I try to fill my life with as much of the ""positive lifestyle"" kind of stuff as I possibly can, but it's not working. I've read everything from the entire Taoist canon to Marcus Aurelius to Steven Hawking to Kierkegaard to Tai Chi masters and beyond. Respectfully, please understand that telling me to just jog it off isn't going to help. I work out daily. I am meticulous about trying to eat healthy. I don't drink like a fish anymore. I need real help and I don't know what to do.",depressed
131,"I think I need to check myself into a hospital. I need your guys' advice.4 weeks ago I got diagnosed with a major depressive disorder. It wasn't really news, I've known I've been depressed for years (approaching 3 1/2 years now). I got prescribed Zoloft, and I'm up to 75mg now. I've also been attending therapy sessions with a psychologist for about 6 weeks now. Its not working though. If anything over the last few months its just been getting worse and worse, and it feels like it's not even getting worse at a slower rate.
 
 Over the last few years I've made a lot of changes to try to help. I went from 198 to 150, I started eating healthier, I changed majors to something that I both enjoy more and that has more career prospects, I transferred colleges since the first one wasn't working out, I joined a few clubs and have actually made a few friends, I even attended my first college party after 2 1/2 years of never being invited to anything. Now I've finally gone to get professional help, both psychologic and psychiatric.
 
 And none of it has helped. If anything, its only gotten worse since I don't even have the hope that any more changes will help. The hope is gone. When I was a kid, I used to get Pneumonia a lot. I had it like 5 times before I was 3. I wish I'd have just died back then, I could have saved so much pain and my parents could have moved on, now I have a ton of other people to drag down with me.
 
 The latest ""I think I would be happy if..."" thing has been getting in a relationship. I think I'm thinking this is the latest thing, since its one of the only changes I haven't yet made, and because I pretty genuinely hate myself (I've pretty much derived any self worth over the last few years from my GPA, I don't really believe in inherent self-worth). I'm almost 21 now and haven't ever been on a date, let alone received a non-platonic hug. Nobody ever expresses interest in me, I always have to initiate (thought I've found this is usually the case with my friends as well, if I don't initiate I'd never get invited to anything). I can't even watch porn anymore without feeling like shit. It's not like I can avoid all these people in relationships either by isolating myself since I still have classes to go to. It feels like all the changes I've made over the years have amounted to nothing.
 
 I'm just so terribly lonely and miserable all the time. I haven't been able to cry in years, so I just self harm when I feel like crying. It's not the best release, and it feels like it has diminishing returns, since lately it doesn't give me the rush it used to, it just makes it a little easier to breath if that makes any sense. Besides, it beats drinking heavily like most 'normal' people my age do (though admitably I much prefer being drunk to not being drunk).
 
 All my friends are out building up lives and resumes and careers. It feels like I've gotten left behind on the road of life. Everyone is dating, some are already married with people they love. I get PMs from one of my friends from high school asking me if I've started dating yet. I keep trying to explain to him that I'm trying but not having any luck. Whenever dating comes up, that's all I ever get ""I'm sure you'll find someone eventually."" Thing is, none of the ""I'd might be happy if..."" things before have obviously failed, but this is the only change left I can make, since professional and medical help has failed.
 
 I don't enjoy anything anymore. Dota 2 and CSGO feel like chores, EU4 is too frustrating now. I've already played through all the RPGs I enjoy to the point of them being mechanical to play through. I don't enjoy running or hiking as much now, and its too cold to do them anyways this time of year. I don't have any shows I really enjoy. I've always wanted to learn to draw, I'm actually a huge fan of furry art, but I'm pretty bad and I'm a perfectionist, so practicing is so frustrating that I pretty much can't do it and get better.
 
 Suicide has increasingly been looking like the only way things are going to get better. The logic I mean with ""get better"" is that zero is still larger than a negative number, so I'd be better off. I used to think ""Ok, I'll wait until I turn 30, and then I'll kill myself if things haven't improved."" However, as things have deteriorated, I've moved that up to 25. More recently, I've moved it up to after graduation (I'm thinking It could be my own graduation present to myself). I don't even know how I'm going to make it that far. Suicide feels inevitable at this point, like its something I have to do.
 
 I don't buy the whole ""it gets better"" thing anymore. Its been over 3 years. It really doesn't in my experience. All the medical advice I've been given when the suicidal thoughts get really bad is to distract myself. I don't understand to what end though? Like, if I don't kill myself now, then what? I get to continue hurting tomorrow? The only end this seems to lead to is ""why kill yourself now when you can just keep hurting tomorrow ad infinitum?"" I don't see the appeal in it. I think once I do it, I'll go out to a nice secluded part of one of my local national parks I like and shoot myself in the head really late at night. Nobody would notice I'm gone, possibly for a few weeks, nobody would hear a thing, I might not even be found. My body can feed some scavengers, I don't have to hurt anymore, people who love me don't have to see me hurt anymore, everyone wins. I've been dead inside for years, its just taking the rest of me a while to catch up. Of course, this is still likely a few years away, so I'm probably not at immediate risk of killing myself.
 
 So thats where I'm standing. It's 3AM right now and I can't sleep anymore because I went to bed at 7 last night because I was out of energy and feeling suicidal again. The Zoloft just gives me headaches, makes me hungry, and gives me constipation. Nothing has helped, and I don't think I can get better anymore.

 Thatâ€™s the oldest Iâ€™ve ever been. Itâ€™s the oldest Iâ€™m ever meant to be.
 
 
 I donâ€™t remember when I had the first dream. It probably happened when I was so young that I wouldnâ€™t even be able to remember. They are always fragmented and realâ€¦ Real in the way that when it ends, your eyes open and youâ€™re lying in bed wondering.
 
 
 â€œDid I just wake upâ€¦ or just fall asleep.â€
 
 
 The fragments donâ€™t seem to follow a timeline; just clips like a hazy recollection of a night out. Remembering moments out of a long series of events.
 
 
 In these dreams, Iâ€™ve seen the events of my life, tragic and wonderful, play out before me. Sometimes months or years before they are experienced in the chronological timeline.
 
 
 It took time to get used to having these dreams; especially the dark ones, the ones where a friend or family member passes and Iâ€™m forced to spectate as a silent observer in their final moments. It wasnâ€™t until my teens that I felt like I understood what they were. As stupid as it sounds, clairvoyance runs in the family. If you believe in that type of thing. Iâ€™ve cousins who experience the same. Weâ€™ve talked about them, shared our different perspectives of events yet to come and those that we didnâ€™t understand until the timeline unfolded in front of us.
 
 
 29
 
 
 Out of the thousands of dreams, every one of which that has so far played in my synapses, not one of them shows me past the age of 29. My 30th birthday is now less than 60 days away.
 
 
 Iâ€™ve lived with suicidal ideation for nearly two decades now. Before I had ever met my wife, I had come to a decision. I wasnâ€™t going to live past the age of 27, in fact I was going to end my life on my 27th birthday. I canâ€™t say for certain why I chose 27â€¦ Partially because I was an angst filled young adult who thought if I was going to die young, I should join the group of others who died famously young at 27 (except Iâ€™m far from famous). 27 also happens to be my favorite number, I could not tell you why, Iâ€™ve always just been drawn to it.
 
 
 When my 27th birthday rolled around I was a newlywed of 3 months. To say that ending my life on that day was the last thing on my mind then would be to lie to you. The plan Iâ€™d concocted still toiled about in my brain that day. But my plans had changed.
 
 
 29
 
 
 It began to stand out in my mind that the dreams never showed me past a certain age. The limit was always twenty-nine. There are none where Iâ€™m a proud father, watching my children go. None of me in my golden years enjoying life with my wife whoâ€™s aged so much better than I over the years. After 29, they just stop.
 
 
 We fixate on negatives, humans that is. Itâ€™s an exercise in willpower and determination to train ourselves to focus on the positives in life and not dwell on the negatives. Iâ€™m far from being a master at this myself.
 
 
 â€œWhy donâ€™t I see myself as older than 29 in any of these?â€
 
 
 Is it because thatâ€™s when my story ends? Will my life be destined to have a dash between 1987 -2017? Am I finally going to break in the next two months and have the gumption to take my own piece off the game board?
 
 
 Or is it something more positiveâ€¦ Does the familyâ€™s clairvoyant trait only take us so far in life? Is it a gift we are given to be shown, in part, the events of our future that will violently shape the people we will become? Glimpses to show us that, no matter how low and dark things are going to get, you are going to make it through this?
 
 
 Maybe we arenâ€™t clairvoyant. Odds are itâ€™s just the family disposition for schizophrenia, another wonderful future to look forward to thanks to inherited genetics. Iâ€™ve already been dealing with auditory hallucinations since childhood, though one might argue those spawned from abuse and not genetics.
 
 
 Is it going to end at 29â€¦ am I going to see the other side of 30? If I donâ€™t, is it going to be my own doing? Maybe Iâ€™m not allowed to see how my own story ends, not until I experience it first hand, so as to not spoil the moment.
 
 
 I donâ€™t make a conscious effort to avoid my suicidal ideation. I did at one point, but then I accepted that part myself. The part that feels, knows, that suicide is an option. I canâ€™t say I go more than a week without at least the tiniest thought of it coming into my mind. That thought of throwing yourself into the void when staring into it. The thoughts just happen and like other thoughts they are sometimes discarded immediately. Others are turned and inspected; what-if situations played out over and over.
 
 
 â€œHow would she react?â€
 
 
 â€œWhat would the funeral look like?â€
 
 
 How many dominos would fall if I cast my own down? Some may topple like my own, but there would be many that would wobble for agesâ€¦ Likely never settling back down into their original position.
 
 
 Thatâ€™s the hardest hurdle for me, in regard to bringing myself to committing to ending it myself. My empathy for those in my life, knowing or at least thinking I know how my life ending would impact theirs. More so if it was self-inflicted.
 
 
 It has always been easy to hurt myself. Intentionally hurting others that I care about though, has always felt impossible. I know Iâ€™ve caused harm to them without the intention of doing so and felt immense guilt after the fact, again and again. So Iâ€™ve never been able to follow through with a plan because of the line of thinking that happens at that point of the planning.
 
 
 Within the next two months am I going to finally disregard othersâ€™ feelings and selfishly satisfy my own, Iâ€™m not even sure what to call it, desire or what I believe to be my stories already written ending? Perhaps it does end, but not by any doing of myself. Just the chaos of existence.

176,"I can't live with this thought, I feel sick. During last summer, I developed a sense of high anxiety around being in the company of young people/babies that I'd never had prior. This was a result of feeling intense distress over finding out that an ex teacher was a pedophile. I came to realize in March this year through research that this is called POCD, which provided me with a lot of relief.
 
 In the late evening of Monday, 23rd September 2019 after having moved back into university halls of residence for my second year a week prior, I basically watched pornography for around about 2-4 hours intermittently when my depression was as its worst height. I'd already experienced false memories by this point.
 
 Anyway, for that whole afternoon and night, I would go from grinding/humping against the bed (an awkward way of doing it that I developed when I was in my early teens) while watching Porn Hub on my phone, to then sitting up and watching random videos on YouTube.
 
 The second to last video I watched was a video of Kurt Cobain and his 2 year old daughter, that appeared on the homepage after going back from Porn Hub and sitting up in bed again. At this point, I remember thinking that if I were to watch this video, I shouldn't watch another video afterwards, purely ''because this YouTube video had a baby in it'' - even though I knew deep down that the two videos were entirely separated by tabs on my phone, not to mention obviously by content. Nevertheless, I watched the interview video, scrolled through the comments and paused at a specific point then went back to Porn Hub, and only then did I kneel down to grind the duvet again, but with a video loaded.
 
 Finally, I remember sitting up again and going back to the YouTube homepage and the first video shown was a slideshow of Cobain's daughter through the years and I remember feeling so much guilt for having watched the prior porn. The reason for this is that - as best as I can describe - seeing her (as a baby, the pinnacle of innocence) exemplified the essential humanity that we all have, including the adult performers. As a result, I felt heavy guilt (that I now realize to be misplaced) for being what I considered to be ''anti-feminist'', and an ''evil person''.
 
 Perhaps I overthink the morality of things, I don't know.
 
 My brain at the time immediately started to go into overload and overlap what would otherwise be two separate actions of watching YouTube then lewd stuff. I remember going to the sink afterwards, and dry-vomiting.
 
 With regards to the actual first-person recollection of possibly staring at the Cobain video, I have no explicit sensory memory of this. The 'image' in my head is grainy at best. I wouldn't have been able to live with myself were this the opposite.
 
 After leaving the bathroom and panicking a lot, I walked through it step-by-step, and eventually felt comfortable enough that I hadnâ€™t done anything wrong and so I left it. This, as a general worry didn't reappear again till May 2020, with the rest of 2019 being spent going from day-to-day worries and false memories. I even felt happy and content on New Year's Day this year.
 
 Surely, if I'd done this horrible thing, I wouldn't have been able to feel anything happy ever again?
 
 At first, I wondered if I did do it, and I just repressed it, or I didnâ€™t and actually itâ€™s just my overactive imagination mixed with my anxiety. I know that in my heart I didnâ€™t do anything wrong, as I had listened to Nirvana plenty of times afterwards, and didnâ€™t feel pangs of guilt or shame that I know I wouldâ€™ve if Iâ€™d done anything wrong.
 
 Things have gotten better mildly. My first appointment with an OCD therapist is soon. I'm currently on the fourth day of taking a beta-blocker to regulate my heart-rate and blood pressure that helps ward off the panic attacks I have about it. I'm trying to sleep better, but sometimes the image creeps in too much. I'm due to get a new set of the anti-depressant mirtazipine soon, too.
 
 But even with that, it all feels like too much right now and I'm more suicidal than ever about this. I don't want to die over an image in my head, but is this a belated guilty conscience? I feel sick and can't think or sleep. I have moments of 'you know you're being silly, start living again', but then it hits my head over and and I end up in bed depressed for another week.

 I haven't been able to go on and cry, get emotional, get real. I'm so fucking done with this. I don't trust anyone enough to talk to them. I have people I know I can trust, but for some reason I don't trust them. Maybe it's because I know that at any moment they can betray me. Reveal all of my problems to someone I don't even know.
 
 Point is, crying is important. If you ever start crying, cry your fucking heart out. Trust me, you'll need it.",depressed
179,"I'm convinced my math teacher hates me I've been struggling with math and it's tough for.me my teacher knows that but still gets mad when I can't get the answer to a question and embarrass me in the middle of class. Then there are my grades I had a c in math and progress reports where going out you only get one if you have a d grade or lower but my teacher gave one to me. And ingot in trouble because my parents expect at least a b. Then last week we had a test. I was getting my grades up I was almost to a b but then I notice I see a day later my grade went down by almost 30 points. And I thought I did well I knew for a fact I passed that test. I double checked my answers triple checked I had to have at least got most right. But then I see I have an f now. The test wasn't even 30 points. Now I'm screwed the quarters almost over and the home work which is most of our grade is only Worth one point IF my teacher grades it sometimes he ""forgets"" so it's pretty much impossible to get your grade up. And his response to asking about my grade is do your work. Pretending I don't turn in all of my work on time. I'm so stressed out 8th grade sucks I hate it. Everyone's mean and distant the more I grow up and my grades can't stay up. I'm going to fucking implode.",depressed
180,"no rewards for resistensehi reddit. i am an anon. i do not know why i am postting this reaaly. perhaps a chance to hear myself speak? perhaps an open forum to categorise my thoughtS? perhaps just because... and because is enough.
 
 ten years ago i gave up on life. i crossed a lne.
 
 it's not despair or depression that keep me beyond that line. it is fatigue.
 
 a member of my family was suisidal. to my knowledge they still are. we don not speak about it. we are unable to now.
 
 i supported them for years. dropped out of school to work and finnancially keep them afloat. i cooked. cleaned. i managed our lives. while they drunk. got depressed.
 
 they had been committed to a mental institution once for a failed attempt. i still remember the smell of that building. the glazed eyes of the patients who were being medicated there. the woman who began a conversation with me saying that she did not kill her husband and the haunting knowledge that i first heard the phrase ""never say goodbye, that is forever. only say see you later"" from her lips.
 
 three years i supported that person. because i love them. we were all the other had in the world. i was too weak to stop them drinking. how could i take away their vice? what else would they do while i worked?
 
 their depression grew stronger. i soldiered on.
 
 eventually it got too much. another failed attempt. they had already taken the pills before i got home.
 
 i always blamed myself for not dealing with them when drunk. i supported in all ways but never well enough.
 
 we argued. i was tired. empty. had nothing left to give.
 
 i yelled at them. i told them how i would benefit from them giving in and just doing it. they did not back down. they called my bluff. they told me to do it with them.
 
 that pure and perfect opportunity to just exit. in that moment i was ready. i was ready because i had given everything and the atlas struggle would finally be over if i just did not fight or resist anymore. if i just let reality wash over me and consume me. ---to this day that feeling of surrender is one of the best emotions i can remember. i was ready.
 
 they backed down when i agreed. they saw what their attitude had done and in a moment of selflessness my family member backed down.
 
 we sat up that night. the pills were still in their system.
 
 they did not die.
 
 years pass.
 
 i move on.
 
 they move on.
 
 that night lives on as a memory only in my head. there are times i wonder if it happened at all. how would i know if it had or had not.
 
 time kept pushing on me. struggle after struggle came and i conquered them.
 
 while caring for my family member i had developed an ability to weather these storms. push through. get through. keep your head down. survive. endure.
 
 god it's such a struggle.
 
 that memory of surrender haunts me.
 
 but i have family now. i have friends. i have people who need me.
 
 so i weather.
 
 i endure.
 
 i found the best way to cope with life is to disassociate with it. not take it on board.
 
 i no longer know how to handle compliments.
 
 my years of training under a suicidal dependant have made me terrified of failure. if i do not live to every expectation i will make things worse. i will cause an episode. i need to do everything. for everyone.
 
 i make life a struggle. i keep heaping on these challenges. taking on more responsibility. breaking myself.
 
 and i never feel satisfaction.
 
 that's the worst part. i don't even feel relief anymore. once i've accomplished something. i just press on.
 
 that has become my life. add on more. feel more pressure. never release. never pride. only failure.
 
 i'm so tired.
 
 and i don't know how to ask for help. i cannot expect anyone to understand. i try so hard to explain it but the words do not come out right.
 
 ""you should feel pride""
 
 ""take some credit""
 
 and if i speak up they take the rug away... ""you should not do so much"" ""you know what happens when you push yourself""
 
 i feel worthless when that happens.
 
 so i just disassociate. stop thinking of myself. stop applying my self to anything. that way i no one will bother me. no one will make me feel worse by trying to rescue me.
 
 i do not feel sad. i do not really feel happy. i just go with the flow. think about how others feel all the time. live to make them happy. at least then my presence will be worthwhile.
 
 i fake it.
 
 i fake it because i can not remember how to be honest.
 
 when people try to get in i kneejerk push them away. i keep trying to push past that. all i can do is offer content without emotion. i cannot apply myself to any story. to any pleas. i just sit here rotting in the back of my brain.
 
 where no one will be dragged in to my void.
 
 where no one will watch me dead on the inside.
 
 where no one will offer pity.
 
 no shame.
 
 no being locked in like i once was.",depressed

However, it is one that is weighing on me and I feel so low that I want to die. I'm a 30 year old woman and have never been ""lucky"" when it comes to dating or relations, however I met someone last year that I felt I connected with. We had so much fun together and I loved to be around him, and we ""dated"" but I felt like I was not good enough to be his girlfriend. He was hungup on an ex girlfriend and when he talked about her it would hurt me each time, I felt like I would never be good enough compared to her. Why was she good enough for him to date but not me? It messed me up so much. He would say things like ""I would be the luckiest guy if you were my girlfriend"" or 'you would be the perfect girlfriend"". At the same time he would brush off discussions I've tried to have about relationships and would say ""you deserve a nice boyfriend"" and things like that. The whole ordeal made me feel awful about myself and I have been in such a depression. We still text but I don't try to have serious conversations anymore since he moved for his job anyways.

 most of the time we commit violent acts because we're angry or frustrated, by commiting violent acts in the game we vent these emotions out in the game instead of in the real world, say for example DOOM(you know the drill we all like BFG division). you might say that video games can culture some really toxic people, but speaking into a mic and speaking to a face are two different things, I have friends that literally gang up on me and ban me from their Minecraft server because they were in a bad mood, the next day I had a few words to say to them and they just stood there and let me run my mouth (I just didn't feel like letting them have their way so I did a thing), that's why I think cyberbullying isn't a problem, if you know how to treat is properly(my own opinion, you guys might know something I don't)

 Anyway...
 
 He's so amazing. I love him so much, our 4 year anniversary is coming up on February 14. I got him his gift and it's currently in transit. I just wanted to say he's literally the most amazing thing to ever happen to me, I wouldn't be the person I am today without him. I... live in an extremely toxic home, and I hate it, I'm not allowed to date but I don't care, I fell in love with someone, and we've been together almost 4 years now. He's so amazing...He's so kind, and charming, and passionate, and loving, and willing, and handsome and cute and literally any positive thing you can think of. He has no flaws. He's so perfect in my eyes. He's been there for me when literally no-one else has. I couldn't be more thankful. I am so lucky, that everyday I get to call this wonderful human mine, and I get to call him cute everyday. Things have been hard with covid, we've been apart 315 days, which is, to most LDR's silly, but he's my only friend. I...am a pretty lonely person, but that's alright. I have about 2 other close friends and that's all I really need. He's literally my best friend. He's been with me through everything. Like I said, I have a toxic home-life, my father is a POS and my mother...she isn't much better. Before him, I knew there was something mentally wrong with me, and to this day my parents still don't really believe I have an anxiety disorder and I quite possibly could be depressed. (not being dramatic it's rough.) He is also my first, well everything just about. This is the first real-real relationship I've been in, he was my first kiss, my first slow-dance, my first everything. He's so timid and gentle and knows exactly how I'm feeling even if I don't tell him initially. He tells me he's proud of me, and the first time he told me that, I broke down into tears. No one has ever ever told me they were proud of me, he sees the smallest steps I take and he recognizing me for them. I've been working my hardest on not apologizing so often and getting a grasp on my anxiety. I know to some now, it's so silly to think that you're first relationship is the one you're gonna marry. But I so truly believe he'll be the one I marry, I want to get married to him, I want to have a life with him. These past 4 years, I haven't felt sad, like ""unneeded"" sad, of course I have days, but he's literally lit my life up. I wrote a poem about/for him last year and in the poem, I talk about how he re-lit my ""spark"". My spark is well myself, my personality, my happiness, my passions my all of it. I don't think I could ever begin to repay him. With everything he's done...I'm overjoyed. And I tell him all of this everyday and he takes it with such modesty, or ""I know I'm all these things, but so are you"" He knows me, he knows who I am, he's the first person to ever willfully get to know who I am, and to love every, single, inch of me, even the parts I can't love right now.

 I moved back home to my grandmas after a stressful two years of college and a failed relationship due to drug addiction on both parties. We were both insanely depressed, I thought I did the good thing moving back home but everyday still feels worse. I miss him so much it hurts. He just overdosed again two weeks ago and I heard heâ€™s doing better but Iâ€™ve decided to go no contact, but I miss him so bad maybe Iâ€™ll do minimal contact once heâ€™s feeling better.. Iâ€™ve had suicidal thoughts in the past, but itâ€™s gone out of control since moving back home. My life has no direction or meaning. All I do is bother everyone. My mind is so hazy that I cannot focus. Getting out of bed is insanely difficult. Going out in public feels like everyone is either scurrying away from me or staring at me, I know itâ€™s my head playing with me man. I feel like a monster and it feels like everyone can see it. Itâ€™s hard making friends and I donâ€™t want to bother my friends down here. 
 
 I had a decent job paying me 15 an hour but it was insanely stressful, when I moved back home I applied to jobs near me and quickly got one as a front desk agent at a nice hotel paying me 10 dollars an hour. Itâ€™s definitely slower paced and cool but the down time is absolutely killing me. My thoughts eat my alive.
 
 I hooked up with an ex two nights ago because I craved being touched but obviously I feel 10x worse. The sex was meaningless he was just ramming my cervix the whole time but I didnâ€™t want to ruin the moment or make him mad by saying it hurt so I just waited for it to end. We smoked after and chatted for a bit. Played some video games and cuddled and fell asleep, well he did but I just stared at the wall for hours. It felt so good to be high again. Yesterday morning at work I was really irritated because my cervix feels insanely sore, I got no sleep, and my emotions are completely out of control. Iâ€™m usually sweet but I felt like a ticking time bomb all day. 
 
 Housekeepers told me to call my boss so they could print their reports because no managers were there. I told them to call them because I was busy, but they stood behind me for 10 minutes while I took phone calls and did my paperwork because theyâ€™re english is bad and they wanted me to do it... they were communicating with me just fine. So I snapped and said â€œwhat do you want me to do?! Did yâ€™all call them like i told you?â€ they said they called the gm and my boss but they didnâ€™t answer their phones and they left a voicemail. So I dialed the sales manager because i knew she was awake because she called me earlier, and she gave me an attitude on the phone and she dates my boss, so he got on the phone and yelled at me not to call her. I said I only called her because him and the other boss didnâ€™t answer their phones, and to never speak to me in that tone again and maybe they shouldnâ€™t tell us to call them whenever they arenâ€™t there if we need help if they donâ€™t want to help. So whatâ€™s the point in their numbers posted on the bulletin board, I ripped it off and told the housekeepers that I canâ€™t help them and to please go away.
 
 I had so much downtime of just standing there and reading news articles that I opened word and typed how I was feeling. It wasnâ€™t meant to be a suicide note, but I did mention how I wanted to do it. Which is unimportant but if anyone is interested, I want to drive far away listening to music until Iâ€™m tired, then I want to drive into a body of water and drown. I donâ€™t know when Iâ€™ll do it but I fantasize about it every day I drive home from work. Iâ€™m too coward to shoot myself or hang myself. I donâ€™t want my family to find me. If my body is found I want my ashes to be spread in fields of flowers and trees. I thought I closed the word document, but I have ADHD and would lose my head if it wasnâ€™t attached to my body. So I had anxiety all yesterday that I left the document open and my boss who yelled at me called me at 11:55 last night and Iâ€™m wondering if that is why. Why else call me at that hour. Maybe Iâ€™m overthinking. 
 
 So now Iâ€™m thinking should I not show up to work? Maybe have a me day? I donâ€™t even know how to have a self care and love day. Iâ€™m just too scared to go to work :( I donâ€™t know if anyone would even care to read this. I feel so lost and lonely. If anyone wants to talk, Iâ€™d be so happy to...",depressed

267,"Just When I Think I'm In The Clear...I was so sure I was over this. But, goodness, this new bout I slammed into is, by far, the worst I've felt in a long time. I understand we're all trapped in our own heads, but I've never felt so tethered down like I have by this awful, sickly feeling that has been plaguing my thinking nonstop the past five days. I know, I know, nobody should get so upset as to contemplate suicide over a girl or guy not taking an interest in them - but dang, I'm not one to feel so strongly about a potential relationship often. At all. So when I do, and I know I'm not doing well, it feels like I'm missing an incredibly important game changer for my life. Yet, here I am again. Plastering this girl with my anxieties as I try to approach her about anything. And this one going wrong is just another lump. Another screw up in a long line of nothing but screw ups for me. Another nail in the coffin, as it were.
 
 And it's not fair to her or anyone else who is subjected to my behavior. I feel like I was just settling into great work relationships with these people at my new job, and then I go out and get drunk with them a few times and tell them all about this girl and my anxieties. And yesterday at work when I tried to joke and talk to the girl...holy crap, I'm an idiot. And a creep. Then there is this other girl I really respect who is roughly the same age my sister would be had she not died years ago, and, during one of our drunken conversations, she told me how I was like ""a little brother"" to her. Of course, this makes my heart swell with pure joy, but then I wonder how creepy does that make me? I'm just a weirdo who pushes away people who genuinely try to care about me by getting too clingy. The past two nights, I'd go out drinking and just tell myself (aloud unfortunately) how it would be best for me to just get this whole load of crap over with. It upsets my friends who were drinking with me. They genuinely do care, but I can tell this attitude I have is weighing on them lately too. Who can blame them? It's terrible. And the more I think about it, the worse I get. And the worse I get, the more I think about it. My descent into pure, unadulterated, 100% self hatred is nearly complete. All of this boils down to one question - ""Am I ever gonna be good enough?"" It just doesn't seem like the case. Anytime I get a good opportunity thrown my way, I don't know how to handle it. I've failed to adapt to society and the world.
 
 Some people are still crazy enough to care about me for some reason though - probably mostly thanks to biology, but I've been slowly pushing away my family in addition to my friends and coworkers. This is nobody's fault but mine, I know that. I just don't want to hurt anyone. I'd rather not put my parents through losing another child. But, once I've got a safe enough distance between my family and me, I may genuinely consider checking out. It's definitely become a legitimate, daily consideration again.",depressed

 Just a disclaimer, I am African American. Iâ€™m sharing an observation and this isnâ€™t an invitation for a racist discussion.
 
 2020 was a wild year when it came to racial injustice. All of these protests and demands for change made me very happy and proud.
 
 Obviously, companies see these protests and come out in support and thatâ€™s fine. But some shows and commercials seems like pandering rather than a genuine desire to increase diversity.
 
 I was watching a paper tower commercial and it was a black animated family. I see a lot of new shows adding a number of black people to their cast. I see Harvard pledging to admit more black students. And many other commercials that you wouldnâ€™t usually see a black face on.
 
 This is all great until you realize that a lot of these companies only do this amid a protest that pertains to race. Iâ€™ve never seen this rush for diversity when instances are â€œnormalâ€ (normal meaning not a huge public outcry for racial reform). 
 
 Maybe Iâ€™m reading too far into it but itâ€™s just what I noticed on television. Companies putting a black face as the star of their commercial and calling it progress. Itâ€™s upsetting and these companies should have a genuine desire to push for diversity rather than pushing for it when itâ€™s convenient to show that you support an agenda.",neutral

281,"Does anyone else feel like they were neglected by their parents just because you were never a problem child? I know this isn't really a thing to complain about, but i've always wondered if anyone else felt the same
 
 I wa thirdborn in my family and homeschooled for the first 10 years. My mother had to school my rwo older brothers before I came into the world and this whittled down my mothers patience. By the time I was needing to be schooled, my mother was already busy enough with my other brothers that she didn't have the capacity to give me very much attention. 
 
 By the time I was able to read well on my own, my mother would just plop a textbook down in front of me and I would go ahead and study on my own. I learned rather quickly that my mother had little patience when I asked for help twice in a row, or took too long to figure out easy stuff. Yelling and occasionally beatings would follow so I stopped asking for help altogether. 
 
 From that point on, almost everything I did was on my own. I would start to fear help itself so I would kick my rear into overdrive and focus the hell out of my times tables or whatever it was that I was studying just to avoid help altogether. 
 
 It wasn't just with studying. I was for some strange reason really sensetive to yelling and I would prefer a beating rather than a scold on pretty much every occasion. Because of this, I learned cery quickly how to be a good boy in the house, not making any trouble whatsoever. Never causing problems and never having any that I had to ask assistance with.
 
 I had fun by myself in those times. Jigsaw puzzles and puzzle books and jacks and whatever other 1 player games I could find, I played them. Keeping all the possible problems I could cause to a minimum.
 
 A decade down the line, i'm now older and in high school. I do exceedingly well in every class and never cause a problem for anybody. I do find myself without a social life which I considered to be a waste of energy at the time. I've also noticed that all my exceptional achievements are going pretty much unseen by my parents. I believe that they just got used to how I was never a problen and now its standard in their eyes. I grew up always being great and pushing into greatness even further is exceedingly difficult.
 
 Now i'm 19 and I feel in sort of trapped in this image I created for my parents that I ""must always be perfect"" and ""never cause a problem"". I've worked so hard to keep this image but I feel like its tearing me down.
 
 I feel really down all the time now. I just feel so unmotivated and unhappy. The ""good boy"" in me says to ignore all that emotional bs and just keep moving along, but its harder and harder to do that every passing day. I just feel depressed. I hide it all from my parents because this would be an issue that I would be putting onto them. ""Sorry mom, but your 3rd child has a problem"". Also, I don't even know if theyll care.
 
 And looking back on this whole situation, I feel like I have only myself to blame. I feel like I was the one who caused my parents to not care about me because I never wanted them to care about me and I avoided it whereever I could.
 
 I'm the one who caused them to look at me the way they do.

283,"The Cold Sore Did Me InLet me prefix this with saying that cold sores are not that bad, but it was enough to push me over the edge. 
 
 So, I've only for sure had one, and I may have had one or two more about a month or two later--but they didn't have apparent symptoms. The point being is that I haven't had anything since my first initial outbreak two years ago. Combine this fact along with the fact that I thought 80% of the population already had it, and that it was very rare to give it when you do not have symptoms. I was wrong. Only 60% of the US population has it (40% is far to high for me to just not care), and you can fairly regularly give it when you have no symptoms. So, now, if I ever want to kiss a girl again, I have to warn her that I've had cold sores, and I also need to avoid oral sex because I might give my partner it down there even without any open sores. 
 
 So, this news is too much for me. I'm already miserable at my job (I've been looking for new work for three months now--my city's economy is horrible). My friend groups are breaking down (mainly people moving away or getting into relationships and forgetting about their single friends). I am not close with my family. And now, I can't even date because I'm a disgusting man who might give you cold sores. 
 
 No, I am not the ""typical"" person who you find on this subreddit. I have numerous hobbies, I stay in shape, I (I guess now formerly) was successful with women, and I had quite a few friends. But I'm lonely. I've lost my three closest friends in a span of six months (one moved, one hates me now, and the other decides that his gf is all that matters in life), and they really were like family to me--especially important since I'm not close with my own. Professionally, I'm going no where and will probably be laid off in May, and, based on my city's job market, I won't be able to find work. Therefore, I am about to become an unemployed and lonely man who is undatable.

 still, i've never been able to completely move on from thinking about suicide: in the best of times, it's distant and amusing-to-think-about, in the worst it's a seriously-considered recourse. i just can't seem to feel fulfilled by any of my relationships, any of my accomplishments. even though i imagine by most accounts i'd be considered a happy, sociable, well-liked person, i feel like i just want to tie up my responsibilities, distribute my things, and get lost. almost unconsciously, i imagine the feeling of the barrel of a gun on the roof of my mouth, or what it would feel like to jump off a bridge or jump into traffic.

 We broke up because she constantly lied to me, she didn't show up when we planned to go out the day after I tried to kill myself. She didn't come to school for over two weeks and she went out with her ""friend"" who she promised she would stay away from as she keeps trying to make her take drugs.

 Shortly before my dad's funeral it became evident to my mom that she was being cheated on and the dude was going to leave her. So at our dad's funeral my mom was crying, not because her ex-husband had died but, because her boyfriend had left her (I know that my parents marriage had ended and she didn't need to feel bad about it, but to me it was extremelly disrespectful to me and my siblings --- at the moment nobody knew why she was so sad). Few days later, we were stil mourning our dad's death and the reason for her sadness showed up...
 
 Now because her boyfriend have left her she is treatning to kill herself. Jesus Christ, My 50 years old mother is treatning to kill herself because her 36 years old boyfriend have left her!
 
 She became insuferable, her facebook is filled with disgusting messages, posts and whatnot about how everyone is garbage and life have no meaning; she have turned away any attempt of help from any relative. She treats her 73 yo mother like shit (I believe that in her head my grandma have something to do with her being dump). She spent her new years eve on a psych clinic but isn't taking any medicine because of no apparent reason and I think that she is straight up lying to her doctors.
 
 She is just making the lives of everyone miserable (and for me, because of the most retarded reason possible) and I don't know how to deal with it... before I try to help and just making everything worse: how do I give support if I can't stand her reasons and am in fact disgusted by it and by her actions? What should I do?

They also stopped letting me talk to or see my nieces 6 months ago. I was manic and delusional and put in the hospital for three weeks before they stopped talking to me. I was stable after a few days but that's how it works (especially when you have good insurance). My brothers took my dog to the pound while I was in the hospital, that devastated me and I was pissed at them when I got discharged. My family said they would stop talking to me if I didn't go to ""psych rehab"" (I haven't ever done illegal substances either than weed) but I wasn't about to be locked up again after having been locked up for three weeks. Or do what they say after they betrayed me like that.

They will never apologize and I don't see how that gets fixed without an apology.

It has been so long since I became disillusioned with this world; the pointless cycle of work and pain to enjoy such small things for such a small time, the uncaring populace that hurts and abuses itself, the vast majority that feel no empathy. I see all of these reflected in myself too, another idiotic follower of the human condition, driven purely by emotion and not by logic. Why anyone would want to live in such a torturous existence is beyond my understanding.
 
 I was born too early to escape it, too. Perhaps a few hundred years in the future space travel may have advanced to a level whereby some reasonable scale of exploration is possible, and I could just leave this hellhole behind, and things may have been different. But as it stands I will be long dead under any circumstances, unable to see the one thing I have dreamed of.
 
 Only music and video games have stood between me and this. They allowed me to hide my dissatisfaction with the world inside myself and ignore it, so I didn't have to deal with it. But they haven't worked now for a good few months. The one time I found something besides those that I thought may have been worth living for was brutally wrenched from me.
 
 This is not a decision I have made without considerable thought. The last couple of months have shown to me just how much I hate this world. Knowing that so many other people feel the same has solidified this.
 
 Nothing I have tried has helped. No antidepressants, no therapy, no thought mechanism has eased the pain. The one person I had trust in and who could help me ran away into the arms of another man, and now I am at wit's end. Nothing stands between me and the hell and that I always tried to avoid, so what's the point in even trying to live with it.

420,"Last ditch effortWhen I was a kid I was abused by my biological dad. I've had a speech impediment my entire life that makes me sound mentally ill. No one takes me seriously. When I was in middle school I was relentlessly bullied. On my second year of college I was diagnosed with Luekemia. Unfortunately, it didn't kill me. My mom and dad divorced and it was so ugly. After I dropped out I realized I was trans. Now every day someone says something to me about how I'm a pervert or a freak. People online are so vile. My anxiety has been ruthless since I was a child. I can't hold a job because I get too scared to go in after the 3rd day. I'm 25 years old, don't have a job, can't keep one. I'm fat. I'm bald. I'm trans. I don't have any worth because I can't labor and so I'm just a parasite on my dad and mom. Every job I attempt (dozens) ive failed at. Its so much. When i do work i come home crying, and in the mornings before i go in i get so scared I throw up. But you need money to live and I dont wanna keep being a burden and pathetic
 
 I don't know what to do. I've tried dozens of medications. Multiple therapists. I was on disability for a while for the cancer, but it ended now. I'm too anxious to leave the house. I'm too anxious to make phone calls or work or do anything. What options do I even have left besides killing myself?

426,"Should I leave a note?I am a 20 year old female. My parents decided that it was a good idea to have a baby with someone they met at AA and subsequently divorced when I was 4. I've been in therapy since I was 8. My first psychiatric inpatient admission was when I was 16 but once I graduated high school, everything went downhill. 
 
 I've tried university but it's so lonely. I'm supposed to be in my 4th year but I barely have enough credits for a single year. I was in the gifted program so all of my high school friends are out there achieving great things and I'm just here binging and purging. Since I've turned 18, I've spent aprox. 10 months, mostly of a form(involuntary), in a psych ward. I've tried ECT twice and I'm only 20. I'm scared that it gave me brain damage because my memory is still fucked. I've tried about 20 different medications. 
 
 Well, I see a social worker, psychiatrist, and a therapist weekly. I'm on disability. Would it really be that much of a surprise to my loved ones? It'd be selfish of them to want me to continue to live this way. I'm diagnosed with Bipolar II, BPD and Bulimia Nervosa. I am just a failure and a burden. There is nothing to look forward to except misery. My friends leave me. My mother just complains about how much money I cost her. Everyone is going to die and I have such trust/abandonment issues that I cannot trust my bf not to cheat on me. 
 
 I can't tell my psychiatrist that I got the pharmacy to refill that bottle of pills security wrestled from me because he will just put me back on a psych ward. I just want to die. There is no hope at all. I don't want to wait until I'm 30 and just be in a worse position. There's no god because a god wouldn't let someone live in such agony. What have I done to deserve this? I try to go to school and smile but it just feels like I am attempting to evade my destiny.
 
 Besides a living will that will say to take me off life support if heavily brain damaged, is there much point in leaving a note at this point? It's pretty much expected at this point.

444,"My life is falling apartHi all, 
 
 This is my first and maybe last post on here. Iâ€™ve had a pretty easy life. I went to good schools. I have wealthy parents who always loved and supported me and pushed me to do the best in life. I have a girlfriend of 2 years who I love so much. I worked in Canary Wharf ( UK Version of Wall Street ) as a foreign exchange broker for over a year and I was pretty good at it. I left that job a few days after I turned 21 to start my own brokerage. I have a group of friends who are always there for each other, my friends are my second family. We always have each otherâ€™s backs. My life should be perfect ya know. Middle class white boy with his entire life in front of him. Then it changed.
 
 A few months ago I was involved in a car accident with a cyclist. I was driving home from my girlfriends on Motherâ€™s Day and just didnâ€™t see them. I missed the first one somehow but hit the front cyclist. They died a week later in hospital. In a few weeks, after the police have concluded their investigation I am going to charged with Death by Dangerous Driving. It carries a minimum of 2 years in prison and a lengthy driving ban. Due to coronavirus the firm helping me setup my own brokerage has folded, I lost all the money I had already invested into my firm from website design and the such, which was pretty much everything I had. My girlfriend is leaving me due to the fact Iâ€™m going to prison for 2+ years. Sheâ€™s also leaving me for a guy she works with, turns out theyâ€™ve been having an affair since early December... and he sexually assaulted her. Apparently Iâ€™m just that bad of a boyfriend she wants to leave me for someone who sexually assaulted her. Most of my friends no longer talk to me due to the accident and the stress of the entire situation is putting a huge strain on my dads already very weak heart. My mum cries most morning and nights over it. 
 
 Iâ€™ve always felt like I was a burden on people my entire life. I feel like Iâ€™ve let people down my entire life. I wish I could be someone different. My brother for example. He is a national swimmer, he has a masters degree in motorsport engineering and is currently an assistant lecturer. He has a house he rents with his friend in Coventry. My parents were always so proud of him. Although I said earlier that my parents loved me and supported me they have never been proud of me. They found out I smoked in year 9, I was never part of a sports team in school, I wasnâ€™t popular. They felt I wasted my potential playing video games and going out with the few friends I had. 
 
 So basically Iâ€™ve decided to end it. My entire life Iâ€™ve let people down, disappointed people and now everything is falling apart around me. Iâ€™ve lost my friends, my girlfriend, my company and soon Iâ€™m going to lose my freedom. I had everything and now I have nothing. I used to be sure of everything and where I wanted to go in life, I wanted to bring my friends and family and girlfriend along with me. 
 
 Now itâ€™s just me. Alone in the dark, lying in bed at 1:42am on a Tuesday morning. Iâ€™m not sure when Iâ€™ll go through with it, maybe a few days, maybe a few weeks or maybe when Iâ€™m in prison.

 A little back story. I spent 3 years working as a nursing assistant where I worked nights, drove my GPA into the ground and spent most of my time binge drinking. One day I tried to drink myself to death by drinking three bottles of vodka. I don't remember much about that night. I blindly texted a few friends but I was told it was incomprehensible. I woke up to a trashed apartment. I gave my landlord my 30 day notice, submitted a request to be switched to evening shifts at my job, told my psychatrist what I did who promptly increased the dosage of a mood stabilzer he was giving me (for a mild case of type two bipolar he had diagnosed me with) and recommended a cognative therapist who specializes in alcohol abuse. I started seeing him reguarly and I thought I was doing good. I started hitting the gym and I ate healthier.
 
 I made a miscalculation though. I thought that switching to evening shifts would make me less moody. Instead I was overwhelmed by the number of coworkers, supervisors, and politics I had to deal with. I got into nasty fights with my long distance girlfriend who had stuck with me through all this. We broke up twice in a three month period due to my insecurities and lack of trust. I'm afraid to tell her anything now because I'm afraid I'll lose the support I had when I was binge drinking.
 
 I'm in the same rut I was before, I feel desperately alone and depressed. The therapy has made sense and has helped a little but its only been able to go so far in two months. Its hard to not beat yourself up when you've lived alone, isolated from about a dozen people for three years.
 
  I feel like all my hard work has been futile now. I stopped going to the gym, I only recently stopped heavily smoking pot to escape. (The constant introspection began to drive me mad.). I feel like nothing has changed. I'm still miserable and I'm still afraid to go back to school even though I want to become a therapist or a social worker. I haven't felt this terrible since I trashed my apartment. I'm worried if it gets worse I may take up drinking heavily again and try to drink myself to death.

 My family knows I'm really depressed and they wish they could help me. My mother tried so hard to make me feel a little better, it just doesn't work out at all.
 
 I have too many repressed memories. I'm sick and basically stuck in bed, can't go out and do things, yet alone go to school or have a job. I'm alone. Well, I'm not ""alone"", I have many people around me, I'm lonely. I was dating a guy who was just like me. He left me, so I would get better. He thought he was dragging me down more. He was the only one who made me feel better. I miss him a lot. It's been 6 months and I still feel just the same way about him. I'm tired of people telling me ""you will get over it"" and telling me I will find someone better. I won't. I have never felt attracted to anyone ever before in my whole life, except for him. And he didn't leave me because he didn't love me anymore or for any other usual breakup reason. I can't forget about him.
 
 It's not the breakup, it's the loneliness combined with all of my problems. Things just keep getting worse for me day by day and I just feel lonely. I wish I still had him, it was all I needed. I just can't get through this alone. I can't. It's too much.

They all say I'm bipolar and give me these bullshit placebo pills that have hardly done anything. I seriously doubt I am, and so I quit the meds that I don't need. I don't experience the very common triggers, nor do I experience the physiological and emotional extremes associated with that disorder. It's all a misdiagnosis. I know it. I don't care if three doctors agreed with it, it's all wrong. These are the wrong meds and they are going to ruin me.
 
 The thoughts came back. I keep going through almost cyclical periods of wanting to go through with a gender transition, only to completely lose interest weeks or months later. I don't know which side to trust. I was going through treatment for it, but I ended up quitting for some stupid fucking reason. Now it's flaring up again. When it flares up now, it flares up to an EXTREME extent. I can't make rational decisions, my emotions are very unstable, and I become suicidal and engage in self-harm. These periods can last from a week to a few months. I don't understand why it's so intense. I literally cannot focus on ANYTHING else besides the idea of transitioning. The thoughts plague me night and day. It haunts me in my sleep. I'm afraid to go to sleep now. I just can't do it. I don't want this to be any worse. It will only get worse as long as it's not being treated.
 
 I'm almost certain this is going to get worse and it's only the first day of this 'flare-up'. I'm in an incredible amount of distress right now. The suicidal thoughts are starting to come back. I can't relax and breathe. I can't get anything done. It's transition or die. There is no other option.
 
 I won't be able to transition in the near future. By then the treatment will have a minimized effect on me. I was fine before this two years ago. It worked. I was fine. Then I wasn't. I'm fucking done with this shit. I'm done. I want to end it. I don't give a shit about anything else at this point. I don't even know how to do it since anything I could use has been removed from the house after previous attempts. But I know I'll find a way if this gets worse. I don't know where this is going to go and I'm kind of scared. I don't want to end up back in the psych ward.
 
 It's not just this stupid transgender crap that's fueling this. I also have a bunch of other psychiatric problems that are keeping me from getting anywhere in life. My therapist even told me that out of all her patients I have the most problems. Thanks doc. I'm told I shouldn't expect to be able to sustain a real 9-5 job that pays well.

I always considered myself to not have to worry about the scenario until I was in my 30's, but here I am dealing with it at the age of 19. I've been criticized and pointed out at how well I'm coping with all of this happening for me, but deep down inside I'm hurt like the rest of them, I'm just desensitized from all the quarrels, problems, and depression leading up to it, not to mention nightmares almost every single night since then.
 
 It used to be just my mother, myself, and my brother all living together. My father left because of a relationship dispute some time ago when I was younger, but he has still been there for me. But since this has all happened, it has felt like nothing but control over the situation. He doesn't want to support me and my brother financially while he's the only one with a job right now, and he can't support us socially because he lives in another city. The most he's done is tell us to get a job and start manning up to the responsibilities that my mother used to take care of, but to be fair, neither me or my brother have had the willpower to do anything since. I want to go and see a grievance counselor with my brother, but procrastination, depression, and anxiety has been getting the better of both of us, and I doubt my father would be willing to help in that regard.
 
 I feel really broken right now. Unable to work and keep up in today's society. Everyone's pushing us forward, telling us what to do, how to do, what we need. I feel it's only a matter of time before either me or my brother hatches an idea and it plays out like some sort of dramatic movie. I asked my brother today how is he feeling today, on a scale from 0 being like any other day, to 10 being that he knows today is his last. He replied 8, I replied 6, although that's probably just the desensitization talking, and I'm probably more closer to 8 or 9.
 
 I feel like this is all revolving around money. It doesn't feel right at all, especially considering that my mother used to get paid spousal support, and she'd spend that money on me and my brother. It now goes all back to my dad and haven't seen anything since. I've tried speaking up against my dad about this, but the most he does is hold what little he supports us on right now over our heads and asks if we want his support or not.
 
 I don't know what to do anymore. I don't know how to live. I definitely don't know how to help myself. A lot of these things, I would have asked my mother to hold my hand and help me do them. She would give me so much support through it until I was able to do it myself, but now all I get is tough love.",suicide

507,"Lied my way out of the psych ward.So a week ago I made a post asking if I should tell guidance about my failed suicide attempt. Someone said I should and I decided to do it. I ended up going to a psych ward as I thought I would and I just got out yesterday. I was telling them that I felt better, when in reality I still feel like killing myself. I just didn't want to be in there anymore because the doctor didn't give a shit. I told him that I wasn't feeling good when he asked how I was doing, and he said ""If I went to the grocery store, and asked how the clerk was doing, I expect them to say good, because that's the polite thing to do. I don't want to hear their whole life story all I want to do is pay for my thing"" which made no fucking sense because it's not a grocery store it's a fucking psych ward. I'm supposed to be honest with how I am feeling. After that he quickly wrapped the conversation up and the next day he would talk about his life. He clearly didn't give a fuck. I want to tell my therapist that I am thinking of trying suicide again but I am scared to go back and I don't know what to do. Any help would be greatly appreciated",suicide

 So this is just plain bad. Kids in GRADE FUCKING THREE are using TikTok and have (probably) seen porn before because of TikTok.
 
 Types of porn on TikTok include people showing off their bare butt, full body cam of naked people, and girls showing boobs.
 
 So TikTok is a place if you're willing to see porn. Otherwise go elsewhere safer because you're not supposed to go on TikTok at school.
 
 However, our school district not only blocks the website but also the API so TikTok is blocked, even on the mobile app.

515,"Suicide is not an option for me. That's not just a tired saying, it's my reality. But if it's the only thing I can think about, where do I go from here?I cross-posted from r/depression. I'm sorry if you see this twice. 
 
 I've been lurking here on my main for a long time, and I don't know that I fit in. I'm sorry if my situation isn't relatable. It sounds really stupid.
 
 I have a great life. I know many people are alone but I'm not, no matter how much I keep trying to be. I try to push my friends and family away but I can't. I had a pretty traumatic childhood, but all those people have been out of my life for a decade and my remaining family are amazing.
 
 Suicide is absolutely not an option for me. I have too many people who care about me (I know, I know how this sounds). Once my dad and grandma pass away, then it's very much on the table - friends and other relatives may be sad but they will get over it. However, my dad was a young parent and therefore is very young and healthy, I've got a couple decades before that becomes a reality. Sometimes I resent that, and that's the darkest thought I've ever had. I've never told anyone this before, but in my worst moments I am upset that my dad - my favorite person in the *world* \- is still alive and healthy and going to stay that way, because that means I have to stay alive for a few more decades too, and I really don't want to.
 
 I'm also gainfully employed, in a job I used to love, and really should still love. I'm not wealthy but I can support myself. My job is incredibly stressful but my coworkers are good people, my boss is a good person, I believe in the work, and it pays the bills even in my very expensive city.
 
 I have friends, and the ability to have more friends, but instead of going out and socializing I just keep pushing more and more people away.
 
 I just don't know where to go from here. I feel like I have to keep it all up - working, being a normal person, or faking it as best as possible. I isolate myself a lot, I never go out, but still my friends are there. It's very weird and confusing. I don't know how I got so lucky. Not only are my friends still around no matter how much I avoid them, but they're all very cool people - they're intelligent and successful and have so much going for them in their lives. I don't know how I've tricked all these people into being my friends, or how I've tricked my job into keeping me employed, or how I've tricked my family into being so supportive. But I have, and I need to undo all of this without hurting anyone.
 
 I don't want to be alive anymore. Every time a minor thing goes wrong that thought hits me like a ton of bricks. Every time I'm alone, and I'm alone *a lot,* all the same. But I don't know what to do. I feel so fucking trapped. But my amazing, supportive friends and family would be absolutely crushed if I told them any of this - and they'd probably have me committed. They'd probably try to make me quit my stressful job, as most of my complaints about life to them are framed around my job (which is stressful, yeah, but a mentally healthy person could handle this - hell, even a slightly-more-healthy version of me from a few years ago could handle it). Then I'd have nowhere to go, nothing to do. My friends and family would get tired of me and I'd be in the same situation as so many people who are alone.
 
 It's like I've got it backwards. I have no reason to be depressed right now, but I am, cripplingly so. But if I tell anyone, my life will be turned upside down and I'll have a genuine reason to want to die for the first time since I was 12.
 
 I just... don't know where to go from here. I'm sorry if this was rambling and hard to follow. And I'm sorry if this sounds self involved or bragging - I don't understand why I've gotten so unfairly lucky in life, either. I wish someone more whole had all these good things going from them. I would genuinely love it if nobody would miss me. I know that sounds awful.",suicide

529,"I'm finally at a breaking pointI have no idea why I am writing this right now. I'm 29 and I'm a fucking loser. I'm a miserable person who sees all the negatives in any situation. I've fucked up every opportunity life has ever given me. Everything to me seems stupid and pointless and I can't seem to find enjoyment out of anything that doesn't involve deep fantasy where I can forget who I am for brief periods of time. 
 
 My parents sent me to two different schools and I fucked up each of them for years and got no degree. I have no real skills that can get me a job, I've been unemployed for two years straight almost. I finally got a job four months ago and got so stressed out at a night time security guard job that I had to quit it was making me so incredibly miserable. I'm pathetic and I have no idea why I was feeling what I was feeling. I can't put it into words, I'd just go to the job and start to feel panicked. I ended up having to find an excuse to quit even though my parents asked me not to. 
 
 Now I'm sitting here jobless wondering what do I do? Even if I get a job is it going to stress me out to the point where I can't handle it? Probably. My father thinks I'm a fucking loser and a disappointment even if he won't come right out and say it. He's ashamed of me and that crushes me, but there's nothing I can do. Shame is something I've come used to, it scares me less than the stress I am going through. 
 
 I've never had a girlfriend, I've never really kissed a girl, I've never had anyone love me back. I've never had someone I could put my arm around and say ""I love you too"" to me. I live completely alone without another living soul around me. I didn't used to drink until I started that job four months ago and now I do it just to feel 'normal'. Like just doing what everyone else does when their depressed makes me feel slightly better. 
 
 I've been laying completely in the dark for hours crying because I have no hope for the future. I'm almost 30 years old and there's nothing good out there coming. I've squandered every opportunity I've been given and it's just too late. I'm a burden to everyone around me. I tried to tell my parents how I felt around the holidays but they didn't get it. They were worried for a few days and kept asking me over and over how I felt until I finally said 'better' and then they figured I was past it all. I wasn't. 
 
 They told me I need to talk to someone, but I can't afford to go talk to a professional. And even if I did, where do I start? How does a professional take my fucked up life and make me want to live it? There's no digging myself out of this hole I'm in. I'm stuck and I'm going to stay stuck. It's too late for me to start changing, too late for me to get a girl, too late for me to fix how I get when I go in public. So fuck it, right? 
 
 I'm crying and screaming at the top of my lungs and I just don't know how to make it all stop. I don't know why I'm putting this in the suicide watch Reddit because I'm too much of a coward to kill myself. I want to do it, but I'm too afraid. I've tried before, but I always chicken out. I'm useless even at that. 
 
 Again, I just don't know why I'm writing all this. I'm somewhat of a writer, maybe I'm hoping it'll make me feel better? I was wrong. Now I just feel embarassed ontop of it. Jesus, what do I do? Do I keep limping along, making people ashamed of me as I keep fucking everything up? Wouldn't it be BETTER for me to just end it?",suicide
531,"BreakupIm 30/m and my girlfriend 21/f left me two weeks ago. She was unhappy sexually b/c I'm not old enough for her. She kept it to herself for 2 years thinking she could change the way she feels about me. When she was a child/teen she was abused sexually by older men and now that is all she is attracted to. She did not expect to fall in love with me when we started dating. I wanted to get married someday. NEVER felt this way about anyone before. Now she is gone. She told me that maybe we could try again but that she would need to make a big change in her life and isn't sure that it would ever happen. Seems like she doesnt want anything to do with me and she said its because it would be to hard for her and me to be in my life. I am going crazy dealing with this. Eating sleeping and getting work done are very difficult. I try to not call her or text her but I usually cave and do it at least once a day. I go by her work and new place to see if shes there at night when I can't sleep. Im really fucked up. I am 2 years sober as well which makes this harder. I cant run from the pain i get to feel everything. I think about killing myself. I just feel like its all getting worse and I cant change it.

534,"My chronic depression is getting worse... This world feels like a nightmare. [NSFL]I'm thinking about suicide a lot...
 
 I want to be dead. I once thought that human problems were surmountable, but they're not. 
 
 They're just not. I only want to live if I can think of a scheme in which humans aren't doomed, and I can't. I've tried and I can't, and that depresses me. Everyone I've ever loved is going to die; I'm going to die. Everyone works hard for things, which they forget about when they die. Everyone feels pain. There's so much agony in the world. So much madness. Small animals by the millions are being poured into grinders alive; their meat comes flowing out a tube, like shit from an anus. Young children are beheading people, but tiny baby arms are so weak they saw the heads off slowly. And then other children listen to music that's merely people screaming. Screaming! This is a world of endless screaming. High-school graduations happen, and the young men and women without scholarships walk away, knowing that they will live lives of struggle, which will be harvested as tax dollars for the state, no differently than the way human batteries are harvested by the machines of The Matrix. The planet is suffering and the minds able to come up with schemes capable of reversing the damage being done are killing themselves. The leaders we elect have values, not plans or schemes. Human history is filled with torture, slavery, and suffering. I hate being human. Most of my friends are depressed because I find happiness intolerable: pathological happiness in the face of this worlds past, present, and future, seems like a crime to me. Every religion secretly prescribes nihilism. Humans exploit one another in life, because nature has been overridden by the state, thanks to human nature. And I feel worlds away from it all. I don't want to participate in human affairs, but go in direction completely opposite to wherever this leads. I don't have any hope for humans... I just hope... That this is all some kind of simulation, intended to teach me how not to behave. What if evolution made us miserable, so we could survive? I don't feel like anyone can relate to me. I don't feel human. I don't understand what I'm supposed to do for you. I don't understand why, as I've aged, I've become more sensitive, and not less. The adults who raised me were so stupid, that I assumed I would become numb when I grew old, but it seems like the complete opposite has happened. These feelings. Was I programmed to function in a smaller world? I drive down the street, and it scares me: that I have this urge to meet everybody I see, but I roll past them like they're nothing. And I'm nothing too. What's the point in being a nothing that feels something? And there's no such thing as help. People don't help; they help themselves by getting jobs. One of my only older friends, she's really jaded about life; she feels like it let her down. She told me that I should try not to obsess over these things (our world and universe is eating itself); that people who do, do end up killing themselves. I just can't though. It's getting harder and harder to wake up in the morning, and when I do wake up I'll go back to bed to cover up my disgusting self. I will delete this post, to cover up my disgusting self, but I promise I won't kill myself. I feel so torn, because I want to like existence, but I don't. And it's the only existence I know!

Cant go to college when you dont have a babysitter. Cant get a good job without college. Etc etc etc. I'll amount to nothing more than a mother now. And for some people that's enough.

I want to not be conscious or aware anymore. I want to cease to be. But I'm terrified I'll do it and get stuck on the other side watching her from afar. If I knew 100 percent death meant emptiness and conciousness death, I'd have done it long before now. And I've struggled w depression, bi polar, borderline personality, my whole life.

All the parties and activities I'm welcome at, are full of old people (as in at least 40 y/o).
 
 I was so glad that I got invited to celebrate the newyear at my boyfriend's appartment, but yesterday the flu kicked in. I was up the whole night (8pm till 5am) vomiting bile and it hurt so much that i even had to sleep sitting up. It was horrible. So, I asked him if he could please, just please, come over here, instead of having that stupid fucking party. But guess what, he'd rather be there ofc. He'll maybe come later tonight, around 11pm, just to fuck obviously. I know he's totally obsessed with the girls that are gonna come to that party ('I just think they're really interesting', yeeah well, especially with those seethrough dresses and giant push-up bras, right.), and it just hurts so much.

I've never felt this down in my life. I think of all the mistakes I've made and I just wish I could go back in time and relive my life, knowing what I do now. I don't know what to do. If I didn't live in a state where it was so hard to get a gun I probably would have shot myself a long time ago.
 I know this is just rambling and probably doesn't make any sense, but I just want to get everything out.

My parents are confused as to why Iâ€™m just disobeying them and my dad is getting even angrier at me daily. This disobedience has only made them take away things that helped me. And the worse my mental state is the more desperate I am to try to bring it up to even the slightest bit. I donâ€™t have the strength to tell them how bad Iâ€™m doing and I canâ€™t afford help even if I could get to it. Talking to my friend has helped a lot but Iâ€™m still getting worse everyday.

557,"I'm a Worthless BastardToday, I really contemplated killing myself. Itâ€™s not the first time. Iâ€™ve considered it a lot of times in my life and I always come up with some reason not to. My family needs me too much. Iâ€™d miss the new episode of my favorite show. For the longest time, the reason I was holding onto was that I didnâ€™t want to miss out on Avengers Infinity War and then Endgame. It sounds so stupid now that I think about it. Then I saw it and, even though it wasnâ€™t everything I thought it was going to be, I was mostly satisfied, and I forgot. It had been so long that I had forgotten that I was waiting for that movie to end things.
 
 It wasnâ€™t until today when I was sitting on the couch, at peace for once. I was genuinely content with myself at that moment. Then my sister came, and she was mad that I didnâ€™t take her son to school today. He didnâ€™t get a lot of sleep last night, had a really bad nightmare about his grandmother (on his father's side) who had recently passed. I decided to let him stay home since it wouldnâ€™t be right to send him to school. My sister confronted me. She accused me of being lazy. She said that all I do is lay around and watch tv all the time. She brought up things; how Iâ€™d never finished school, how I didnâ€™t have a job, how I didnâ€™t have any friends, and that the only thing I had in this world was those stupid action figures that I collected. She called me a Worthless Bastard and said that I was going to grow old with nothing and that I better not expect her to take care of me when our mother eventually dies.
 
 A worthless bastard. That really hurt. She thinks that I am a worthless bastard. My own sister. I waited until she left the house and then I cried. I really got to thinking about my life.
 
 She's right. I don't have any friends. I dropped out of college to take care of my mom when she got sick and now I don't have a degree. I'm 23 and still a virgin. I've never even had a boyfriend cause no one ever wanted to ask me out. I was a home care provider for my mom but then I was fired when she changed insurances. No Job. No money. I fill out an application for places and get rejected. I go in for interviews and get rejected. I'm so tired of getting rejected.
 
 I just hate my life. I hate everything about it. Every time I leave the house I just feel like everyone is laughing at me. They can all see how awful I am and are thinking about how much they hate me. I know I'm being irrational. It's just how I feel so I haven't left the house, other than to drop my nephew off at school and pick him up, in days and even then I don't get out of the car that way I don't have to face anyone. I just go home and hide.
 
 I used to be so Smart. I think about how Smart I used to be. I think about my goals. My plans for my life. The things that I wanted to do. I was going to be a doctor. I was going to go to college out of state and It was my plan and Iâ€™d tell anyone who would listen about my plans.
 
 I endured a lot of bullying growing up and people were always telling me that I was worthless. I was always going to be worthless. I remember in the first grade that I was excluded from games and I didnâ€™t have any friends. The Bullying continued throughout Elementary and Middle School. Bullied at school and then bullied at home by my sister and my grandmother. All my life everyone has always told me that I was ugly. that I was stupid. That I was lazy. That I couldn't do anything right. That I was a dumbass. And whenever I'd cry I was called out for being sensitive. Why was I so sensitive? Why couldnâ€™t I take a joke? I was always a target, and there were days when I considered killing myself just for relief. But I didnâ€™t. I stood in front of a mirror, tears in my eyes and I said, â€œNot yet. I canâ€™t do that to my family.â€
 
 But I think about it now that Iâ€™m older. All my life, I was told that I had to take care of my sister. She has a mental disorder and my mom was always telling me that one day when I became a doctor that I had to support my sister. Look after her. I used to have nightmares about that. Nightmares where my mom was a ghost telling me to look after my sister. And after she had my nephew it became, ""Look after both of them.""
 
 Now, I'm nothing. I didn't become anything. I didn't prove anyone wrong. I can't take care of anyone. I'm a waste of space. A worthless Bastard just like she said. I feel so worthless and tired. I hate myself so much. I just wish I was dead.",suicide
561,"Confusion, suicide and a sick petIâ€™ve been having a lot of suicidal ideation. Itâ€™s different this time though because I truly feel Iâ€™m not meant to be on this plane in existence. I finally realize that waiting out this pain is rather pointless because itâ€™s going to re-emerge again and whatever contentment I find in the spaces between isnâ€™t worth the darkness. I manic-depressive and I canâ€™t trust my own brain, my mind. Itâ€™s the worst itâ€™s ever been this time.
 
 My cat stopped eating about a week ago. Heâ€™s going downhill and the doctors just figured out whatâ€™s going on but the situation is dire itâ€™s probably too late. I donâ€™t know what to do. Supposedly he has a 79% chance of bouncing back, but in the meantime heâ€™s on a feeding tube that I have to tend to every hour and a half. And any other time in my life, I would jump on the chance to help my companion animal get through a hump like this to live. But right now, well Iâ€™m suicidal, I donâ€™t know why am torturing him and torturing me in the process.
 
 The vet said itâ€™s not torture. That he looks worse than he is. Iâ€™m not concerned that this vet is bilking me for money, believe me. He really thinks that if we do the tube feeding for about a week that he could be fine for another three, or five, or 10 years. But I donâ€™t want to be here another three, or five, or 10 years. I feel horrible that instead of snuggling with me like heâ€™s always done, my cat Stays in one spot unless Iâ€™m coming to feed him and in that case he runs away. Like bolts away for me, running into things along the way because he has the Elizabethan collar on.
 
 I donâ€™t know if itâ€™s good for him or me to keep doing this. I donâ€™t know if I put him down, I might come to me angry that I didnâ€™t do everything I could. And I donâ€™t know if that outweighs the anger Iâ€™m going to feel if he is deteriorating to a point of no return and his last days with me are horrible. 
 
 I fantasize about killing me and him. Why delay the inevitable? This pain isnâ€™t worth it. We could be released from everything.

 I've made my share of fuck ups, so of course to her parents I'm the crazy ex who they despise and want nothing to do with.
 
 Yet she's always let me back in, she's always made my heart beat in a way that I never thought it could. She's made the coldest nights warm, and the most painful of injuries turn numb. But she lies. A lot. And I forgive her, I let her in, hell I let her walk all over me but she will suddenly claim one day a week that she wants nothing to do with me. This is how it's always been.
 
 But this week pretty much ended it all for good. Her dad got involved and all kinds of shit (even though we're both 19, yet her parents need to control her life.)
 
 So I'm left here alone, without even the utterance of a goodbye from the woman I've spent the last two years on. Trying to help her beat the battle of depression that I haven't even beaten myself. Tonight the war was lost. I'll send a link of this to her so maybe she can read it. Not that it matters, I've made this up before, but I'm truly going through with it tonight. I'm gonna smoke, then go for a walk, and never look back. Probably won't make it through the night. I love you..if you're reading this.

583,"Help with SO who is suicidalHi guys, I am in a tough place right now. 
 
 Quick background on me: I have moderate-severe clinical depression. Earlier this year I went to the ER twice for suicidal ideation; before that I had stopped eating and sleeping for three days at a time. I self-harmed every day. My symptoms are *completely managed* by now with meds and therapy and I no longer have suicidal thoughts. 
 
 I just started dating someone (trans nonbinary, assigned female at birth) who has depression and suicidal thoughts that don't enter the planning/methods level of detail, which is good. 
 
 I am struggling because my SO refuses to consider medication for reasons that aren't medically accurate, and relies on me to be their ""antidepressant."" (I make them feel good when we see each other.) Obviously, I understand how awful depression is and knew that going into this relationship, but my SO's refusal to get medical care for their depression/using me to make themselves feel better is really starting to take a toll on my own mental health. 
 
 They got upset at me (over text) when I said I couldn't meet this weekend because I have midterms this next week (I am in a very involved premed program). 
 
 They live about 90 minutes away, so most of our communication is via text/video calls. A couple nights ago we had this exchange: 
 
 SO: I want to die 
 
 me: Do you think you're going to hurt yourself tonight? 
 
 SO: I'm already hurting myself 
 
 me (at this point, shaking because I am upset and afraid they're attempting suicide/self-harming): How? 
 
 SO: I'm trying to write an essay, I can't type both. 
 
 A similar scenario has gone down a couple times; my SO saying they want to die/""end my suffering""/""end me"" and then when I try to figure out what's going on, I'm called a ""nerd"" or told ""stop worrying about me"" (harshly) or even just ignored. One time, they said they wanted to kill themselves, I responded saying something like, there are other ways to make the pain get better, what can I do for you, and was met with ""what are you going to do if I kill myself, spank me?"" 
 
 That message honestly made me sick to my stomach. 
 
 I really care about this person but this is taking a serious toll on me. I understand what it's like to be in that dark, awful place but I feel like I'm being played with, especially with the suicidal comments that, when I inquire about them, I am met with sarcasm or teasing. It is hurting me. I have had the urge to self harm multiple times since I got into this relationship and have had to ban myself from going to certain places where I could obtain the means to do so. 
 
 What should I do, you guys? I donâ€™t know what is going on, I donâ€™t know if my SO is being serious or messing with me, I donâ€™t know how worried I need to be if their thoughts never enter the planning stage, and I donâ€™t know if I should stay with them if this continuesâ€”not because they have depression, but because they wonâ€™t address it, against the advice of numerous medical professionals. 
 Weâ€™ve only been together a month. I really like them and am willing to be there for support, but Iâ€™m not an antidepressant. Iâ€™m a person with needs and a history of severe depression. I really donâ€™t want to fall back into hurting myself. Please help me figure out how to navigate this.",suicide

615,"It's just one more monthHey,
 
 Was planning to post in /r/depression, but this felt more appropriate.
 
 To sum up, I'm transgender, 20 years old, extremely severe depression, no treatment. Went off one of my anti-depressants a month ago due to side effects, asked my doctors office for an emergency appointment.
 
 Still haven't heard from them. Things are worse than ever. Today I got out of bed, went straight into the bath and fell asleep. Five hours later I got up and went back to bed and slept until my mother got home.
 
 After she walked the dogs, she asked me what I had for lunch. I considered lying, but I didn't have the energy. I told her that I had a piece of old stale bread for lunch, which was the truth. She got angry that I wasn't eating properly, not upset, not sad, angry. She then got angry I didn't empty the dishwasher.
 
 After a while, she came back to my room and told me that she wasn't cooking dinner for me if I stayed in bed. I couldn't bring myself to respond, I just laid there. She's currently eating dinner, and I'm in my room still.
 
 In a month I meet with the trans care people again. This time they might tell me that they've decided to treat me. Probably not though, it's been 2 years and they haven't moved a step in that direction.
 
 I know that I would probably feel better if I actually managed to see my doctor and get another med. I know I probably wouldn't be spending the entire day sleeping and/or thinking about ending it. I can't bring myself to do anything, though. I can't pick up the phone. I can't eat.

They look at me all the time, Iâ€™ve missed millions of opportunities. But I feel so unable to reach out. Like Iâ€™m trapped inside myself for having been isolated for so long. 
 
 I hate myself so much. My life is a complete failure. 
 Sometimes it occurs to me in a flash that the idea of ending my life is an aberration as the gift of life is such a sacred and gorgeous thing, and I mean I really feel it in a deep way. 
 Also Iâ€™m fully aware of my potential (which is in part why I despise myself so much). But in moments like now (and theyâ€™re getting more and more frequent and intense) all I can think of is my pain. 
 
 The lack of socializing, physical affection and sex leads to a very real physical pain at this point. I feel it all over my body. Like a wave that envelopes me and ends up focusing right in my heart, like a frozen fist clenching suddenly around it. 
 
 And believe me Iâ€™m not letting myself go. Iâ€™m fighting with all I got. Iâ€™ve quit smoking (both cigarettes and weed), stopped fapping and watching porn, I exercize daily, meditate, take cold showers, go for walks, got back to photography, which was a big hobby of mine, and started seeing a therapist. 
 
 But no matter the efforts and although Iâ€™m getting positive results in some regards, the loneliness is just too fuckinâ€™ unbearable.

 I have no family here. I have no family within 2000 miles. My ex wife won't even check on the kids, let alone give me child support. she's too busy snorting her money up her nose.

I'll call my family doctor to see if he can prescribe me some stuff, because I had to stop my treatment. Ran out of pills.
 
 So many bottled up feelings inside of me. I want to put them out, ALL of them. I feel like I'm falling apart day by day, my creativity is blocked despite having plenty of ideas, I just can't get to do them. I can't confess to my best friend because I'm afraid I might lose her friendship, especially since she's got a boyfriend. I left many of my old friends because those assholes left me right when I needed them, and despite talking it out with them, I can't fucking go back to them like I used to. I met new people, but I can't get myself to truly go towards them. I don't want this anymore. I don't want to trust people, and have them care more about the death of a fucking idol than about their depressed friend. 
 
 The true reason why I'm currently seeing family is that I don't want to be alone. I'm afraid I might do something stupid if I stay in my dorm room. I just want someone to hold me and tell me it's okay. Let me cry in their arms. Listen to me. I can't show this part of myself to people because depressed people like me become a huge pressure. They usually leave right after. One of my friends did, and it was the last time I came close to suicide.

I'm back to hating everybody I talk to and feeling only fleeting instances of an emotion that could only loosely be described as positive.

I lack confidence in everything I do, even in simple basic things. I don't understand how this life works and I feel like I never will.

 I don't know how to tell her she's a strong and beautiful person, that she's worth it, that I love her no matter how bad things get.

706,"I'm only 20 years old but I constantly think about the process of ageingSorry if this is too long.
 
 I'm ""only"" (""only"" according to what people say) 20 years old, and even though I wouldn't say I feel ""old"" exactly, I'm always thinking about our finite youth, about ageing and our mortality. I can't get it out of my head.
 
 A new song from a band I like comes out and I realise they're 33, and I immediately start imagining myself in their shoes, as a 30 year old, with a lot of nostalgia of the past and thinking about my past and my past mistakes. I'm inevitably miserable in these pictures.
 
 I see people I like, admire or love age and that induces me into a profound existential crises. I'm **extremely** scared of ageing, you probably have no idea how much it scares and paralyses me. I'm scared of regrets, I'm scared of ending up a nobody, I'm scared of working a job I hate and that drains me emotionally.
 
 I can't stop thinking about my past regrets and worrying about doing things now that I will regret in the future. I feel so much guilt when I'm not 100% efficient in what I'm doing. I feel so bad about myself, my laziness and my inability to spend long hours focused and studying. I guess I hate myself for allowing myself to get defeated so easily by difficulty, I hate myself for being too weak. I really REALLY want this thing but I'm so fucking lazy and when things get difficult I just can't pull through. I want it so much that I want to cry. It's more like a necessity than a mere desire.
 
 The idea of having obtained this dream of mine is super motivating, but having to do the work exhausts me *emotionally*. I know at least one of the reasons why this happens (meaning perhaps there are others), but I'm too embarrassed to tell anyone, let alone publicly. The past month when mom came to visit me and help me with my breakdown, with difficulty I partially told her my ""dream"", why I want it, and why it's so important to me, and why working hard to achieve itself is so painful.
 
 It's not a crime or anything like that, but it's something I feel is ridiculous and laughable, something silly and that demonstrates how weak I am (or have become).
 
 One of my fears is *having* to commit suicide in the future (between 2 and 4 years from now) due to an unbearable amount of regret and guilt. I *know* I won't find any other solution but to commit suicide if I don't achieve my dream at least partially or if I don't achieve it in the time period I *need* to. This is because my goal heavily depends on my age, and it has nothing to do with a decline in my capacities or anything like that. My goal is along the lines of ""enjoy your young years doing things that 20 years olds are"". Time itself is part of the ""specifications"" of my goal.
 
 30 year olds or late 20 year olds hanging out with early 20 year olds is weird and unacceptable, and I wouldn't feel part of the group either. I want to hang out with 20 year olds AS a 20 year old, but right now I can't. I've already wasted so much time isolating myself for 6 years in my room with my computer, not hanging out with people my age, not gaining experiences, not making memories, but now what I want is something slightly different. And being so ""ambitious"" or ""demanding"" sometimes makes me feel bad too. Perhaps I'm just a spoiled kid who hasn't grown up yet and learned of life.
 
 Maybe I have to stop being so stubborn and unreasonable, make peace with a life without this delusional, grandeur dream of mine, and live peacefully where I am. I know progress can't be accelerated so much, I do know it, but I so wish it could, you don't know much this pains me. Life is so painful, ageing is so painful, your face changing and getting more 30-year-old-looking is so painful. I want to stay this age forever, hang out with people my age all over the world, celebrate with them, suffer with them, talk with them, know of their dreams and fears, learn about their subcultures, be part of the group, etc.

754,"I'm mentally deficient and I refuse to live with it.Hi, I'm Steve. I'm 17, I live with autism and mental deficiencies, and I'm going to kill myself right after I submit this god damn post.
 
 I'm not posting this because I want help. I'm posting this because these words need to go somewhere, and honestly I don't know of a better place where a message like this would be acceptable.
 
 Back to the subject. I'm autistic, and I have some really bad mental deficiencies and it's fucking killing me on the inside. I took a cognitive test when I was 15. I have an IQ of 77, and I was ranked either ""Deficient"" or ""Borderline Deficient"" on everything. Fuck. It's so hard living with the fact that your limits are so fucking low compared to the rest of the general population and you will never fucking be able to achieve your dreams because of some bullshit that I can't fucking help.
 
 I'm in the special education program at my school and I fucking hate it. They teach jack shit and group me with kids that screech and shit their pants. I can talk normally, I just don't want to unless I'm asked. I'm mentally fucking deficient but I want to be taught something that's above preschool level. I've tried telling my mom it's not enough for me but she just dismisses me and tells me I won't make it in mainstream education. I try telling my special ed teachers I want more, but they dismiss me too and then make jokes about me behind my back like I can't fucking hear them. Hey, Mr. Janssen, when you read this, fuck you. I heard every little bit of shit you talked about me. Mrs. Huang, fuck you. I heard you call me inbred. Ms. Baker, fuck you too. I get it, I'm not smart and I never fucking will be but I want to be taught more than fucking preschool shit. Fuck.
 
 I'll say it again: you have no fucking clue how hard it is to live when you know that your limits are much much lower than the average person, you will never graduate high school, you will never go to college, and you will never get any respectable job, and generally your life will be very unfulfilling. I always dreamed of being a coder, but guess what? That requires you to be smart and guess who isn't smart? Me. I tried to teach myself. It doesn't click and while I love it I'm so fucking bad and it takes me hours to figure out things that are ""super basic"". I can't do it. It's too hard.
 
 I'm not willing to live a life in which I can't be a normal person. I just want to graduate high school, go to college, get a good job, and just have a normal life. But all of that has been made inaccessible by the fact that I'm in fucking special ed and won't even graduate high school and will forever be dependent on my parents.
 
 I don't want to burden my parents any more by being the dead weight piece of shit that I am. And I don't want to doom myself to a life of suffering.
 
 I hope you all can now sympathize with me.

 so ya don't wreck my life and find out who i am. 
 
 I just called a crysis hotline, and it was busy, lol and I called 5 more times and it was busy twice and then it rang and I hung up and then I called twice more and it was busy both times. then I found another line for some local crysis centre.
 
 i used to work as a telephone surveyer, it was like someone trying to sell me a long distance plan over the phone, just keep me on the line and keep trying to make the crysis center upsell. special one time offer! how about we send a mobile crysis unit and they come talk to you.
 
 actually that sounds terrible, I just wanted to talk to somebody about my problems because my doctor can't see me till feburary and I have no friends and my parents are a large part of the problem. so basically I am alone, I am completely and utterly alone and nobody really cares.
 
 it's all up to you she says, wow what a thing to say to someone with depression, yes I know all my lifes decisions have been made by me, i know that my life is either shitty or it isn't based off my actions. I very much know that. why would I be depressed if I didn't blame myself? just fucking terrible, now I'm just drainned and sorta just pissed off instead of suicidal.
 
 it's like the only support they will offer is putting you in a halfway house... well I work fulltime so that's not gonna work, and I don't have vacation days, and I work nights, so one of the things they do there is get you on a routine and give you support classes and whatever. well that's not really gonna work if I get up at 8-10pm and go to bed at noon-2pm
 
 so basically the only support society has to offer is completely fucking up my life, I actually don't mind my job, I actually like it there, it's the one safe spot in the world is work. I live at home and I live my parents who raised very very fat, I was obese by kindergarden and I have been since. but I know it's not there fault because we are all only to blame ourselves for our problems. then I tried to start losing the weight and I almost lost it all, and then it's just they leave open bags of chips and cookies and chocolauts and just the most unhealthy high calorie garbage all over the house, but why don't I just move out? well because I tried to start a business with my credit and it didn't work out and now my current job barely pays off my loan payments and I've maxed out my credit cards paying them rent(which they feel they rightously deserve and are the greatest parents they know in their lives for not just telling me to get the fuck out.) I didn't even ask them to change their habits, I just asked for them not to leave junk out where I can see it. this was responded to in a way I only decribe by saying. have you ever tried to take food away from an aggressive dog? and they growl at you just completely almost out of charecter, just an instintive aggressive violent response with no reason or consideration.
 
 so now I'm stuck and I really wanna kill myself just because I know they will get stuck with my debt. I'm not even hopelessly in debt, I just can't leave here, but I can't live being this fat anymore, because nobody will love me, or even even affectionitly touch me, I don't even mean sex, I just me anything not out of sympathy or pity from a female. you know I don't even blame them for regecting me anymore, they all actually out of their way nice to me
 
 so ya whatever I guess, I'm taking some art classes, and I found out I'm very talented, lol I'm a very honest person in a way that's great on camera. But I'm fat and people don't have sympathy for fat people(well unless there in the process of asking forgiveness and making claims of future weight loss) if you just try to put them in a normal life situation, people inheritly react negatively, because fat people are ugly, I think it too
 
 but ya I can't fix it. I know people won't accept this statement, but when I'm on my ""healthy diet"" I feel great and am not hungry because it's well balanced and not extremely low calorie. But I come home from work and it's just there is food and sugar everywhere, and as soon I get eating it, I want more and then i don't care because I think I've already fucked it up for myself, I might as well just eat more so I don't feel bad.
 
 and then i feel great for a little while and then I crash off the sugar and I feel terrible, I feel god awful I feel doing nothing in the world that won't seem like unenjoyable effort. and I just think about how bad I feel and how much I don't want to feel that way anymore and how much I wish i could just do something that would make me feel better. so I get in my car and I drive to one of the oh so many mcdonalds and I get 3 double cheeseburgers and each has 400 calories, that's 1200 calories I can eat in I dunno. 4 stop lights away from the mcdonalds. and that like more than half of my total daily calorie needs. on top of the regular diet which is about 500 under my daily needs and the fucking near thousand calories of just junk food my parents leave around. then all of a sudden I'm like 2000 calories over my needs and then that's evey day, and that's like all in the last 3-4 hours of the day. and the next day maybe I just don't care anymore and instead of coffee or diet coke in the morning for caffiene maybe I go and get two 400 calorie energy drinks. and the high is so good and the crash is so hard and I eat a couple more thousand calories of junk when I get home and feel terrible from crash.
 
  it's just I meet people and I fall in love with them and I can see they care about me, they go out of there way to be nice to me because they see how down I get on myself. but if I ever try to just anything, just any interaction beyond this totally not out of your way interaction. I know we're in a art class and you say things to me that let me know you don't hate me, because I act like I think you hate me, but it's not because you hate me, it's because I love(yes I know I don't know what the word means but I like to use it) you and you'll regect me and it's easier for me to perceive it as hate, and you go out of your way to say it isn't and you care that little bit. and I think why did she say that and you think maybe she likes me and it's just this natural reaction and attraction, no desperation, there isn't time to get desperate and you just say ""I'm gonna play it cool and later maybe do something."" and then you get home and you remember, I'm almost 300 pounds and she was just being nice and if I you even tried to talk to her directly outside of what the art deems nessisary she'll regect you like everyone else because you've done that, that same thing has happend dozens of times and you've played it out like groundhogs day, where you've done every possible thing, reacted everyway, tried everything(including not trying) and it has all ended the same.
 
 you know the worst part lately is I started going to the gym 2 years ago and I'm actually in pretty good shape, I'm just really really fat, I lifting and flexibility and I cycle(even though it's really hard being so fat). and I got down to I'm 6'2 220 which the lightest I've been in ever, even as a kid I always had a higher body fat percentage, the first time I've been under 30bmi since I've remember checking my weight. and now in 5 months I've thrown away all of it and gained 50lbs and I remember how hard it was to lose, and I remember I had all the advantages of starting something new and being excited about my new diet and just being able to ignore the junk food(mostly it was always an issue, always adding a few hundred calories here and there). and now it's like you can sell everything you own, get your debt to a controlable level and move out, but I have to move walking distance from work, because i bought a car when I was younger and I broke down and I lost my entire investment and my oh so generous and horribly unappreciated parents let me drive one there 4 vechiles to work, after they moved and took me with them, it was a mistake to move out with them, but I would have no car and I couldn't take my art classes, or even have access to a gym because there isn't one around my work where I would have to move to and only be able to walk because there is no public transportation around there.
 
 so ya I was looking for place in the river to jump in(thin ice around some shores), and I'm not tryhing to violate the rules, it's just it seemed like a good idea, I was just gonna jump and swim to shore(if I could make it) and that seemed like a good idea. then just go to the emergency room and cry and they would have to something, I dunno, it seemed lik,e the only way to get any attention to my suffering without having to get in a confrontation with someone. but whatever I'm really tired now and I just want someone I dunno. there is nothing I know nobody can help me, the things I want that will make me happy I can't ask and don't have any right to ask. but crying makes me tried and I don't like having to hear myself, crying wouldn't be so bad if I didn't have to hear the whale, it's like someone else, it's like I'm hearing some other person in the most heart breaking hopeless disappar and it frightens me. I'm just thinking wrong, reacting wrong, I just don't interpet the world correctly and everything that makes me meserable is all in my head and is all just a chosen personality flaw that I need to get over, or go to therapy for.
 
 and all of this will start over again tomorrow, but it'll be friday so I can play video games on the weekend and maybe I'll get some mcdonalds and a big sugar slurpee and I'll be happy, that's what I have to look forward to. the only thing good in my life is the thing that makes so terrible.",suicide

She only stopped because it turned out to be a pyramid scheme. She's also done the same thing other times like buy beanie babies but I wasn't alive at the time.

797,"Lost my job this morningSorry in advance for my lack of cohesion and my stream-of-consciousness way of writing this all down. 
 
 I was fired from my job in customer service this morning, an all-time low. I couldn't stand waiting for rude people to call me while sitting in front of my computer for 8 hours a day and it has been depressing me terribly this past year (only been working in cs for a year). Maybe part paranoia, but I felt like it was treated like the lowest position in the company (SaaS type company, ~100 employees) and frankly I was embarrassed of it. I hated every day and although I'm not dumb enough to ever quit a decently paying job, I'm ostensibly not above being largely inconsistent in my work there due to my internal struggle with where I am as a 30 year old. I hated it and couldn't ever keep up a charade for long. 
 
 Full disclosure, I've had suicidal ideation for approximately 15 years. I survived an attempt when I was 14 and professionals will tell you it's increasingly common for repeat attempts to occur in the wake of the attempt. In spite of all of this - I've beat the odds, graduated college, landed a pretty great job with my degree in 2011 but screwed it up and ended up being fired after a year and a half. I was out of my league (not really an unexpected thing when post-college) but my pretty rigid defense mechanism that I've had these past 15 years caught up with me. I have a propensity the be highly critical of those around me, as well as myself. I can do a 180 at the drop of a dime on how I feel about someone. I guess you could say I'm a pretty emotional little guy, internally.
 
 My parents divorcing after around 34 years have contributed to my emotional state, this happened maybe 2 years ago. I was very much in the middle of it and they both ended up being (what I consider to be) immature, dishonest and manipulative towards me. At the end of it all, they both moved out of state. My family outside of them has been pretty much zero, partially my fault (embarrassment after my attempt, too). Suffice to say, Christmases throughout high school consisted of just them and me and sometimes my one sister (whom ran away at the age of 17 to be with her current husband).
 
 Also of note, my parents were rich growing up, and you could probably say I had a silver spoon in my mouth for most of my life. MANY extravagant vacations when I was young and pretty much through college. I've seen a lot of very beautiful things and had it very easy for a lot of my life. Which is why I'm even more willing to let go of all of this. My life isn't going to get any better and I don't mean to drone on too much with my narcissism but I've just had it. I've had a lot of great memories that I'm able to smile about. I've been fortunate enough to fall head over heels in love with and date a girl during 3 years of college so at least I know I've truly lived. I just don't ever want to make the mistake of having children that have this same depressive affinity that I do. 
 
 These last 15 years have been so volatile for me, I don't think I'll be able to do another 15. It's most assuredly fucked up how often I think of suicide, I know that. But I've survived 15 years feeling this way... 15 years of introspectively daydreaming of suicide....as an easy out type fantasy, as a realistic look of the world and it's brevity...my brevity.
 
 I just want advice. I've done therapy and it opens pandora's box. I tried celexa for a year, two years back, and it turned me into a hypermanic mess.
 
 The only thing that makes me happy is music. I can sit at a piano and improvise beautiful compositions off the cuff. It's catharsis for me to stave my loneliness at times. Sometimes I'll play for an hour straight, and just start crying midway because of how much I keep inside. It does help, though.
 
 I know this all may seem quite pathetic and obvious in terms of an answer to you guys, but I just had to get this out. I still feel godawful at the moment but better than when I started.
 
 Someone please give me words of advice.",suicide

811,"19, Queer, and pointlessI've been struggling with these thoughts since middle school and each year they only seem to get worse. Ever since I've realised how pointless I was compared to my peers they've permeated in my head. I've always been the outcast amongst people and groups of friends. I'm never the one that gets invited to parties or to hangout and they're all busy when I ask them to without fail. High school was a period of constant put downs and anxiety. I hadn't realised I was gender queer at the time which greatly harmed my sense of self identity and my ability to present who I was to others. Because of this I've been particularly social awkward and anxious. College was where things were supposed to change. New faces and new resources. Things almost immediately went to shit. I could get myself to classes or meet people outside of my hall. When I finally realised I was gender queer I felt/feel like a freak. Being a nonbinary AMAB means receivimg a fraction of a percent of the acceptedness and support your binary AMAB peers receive. I've tried attending GSA meetings but I've only been treated as even more of an outsider since I don't fit their concepts of queerness. Spring semester and this semester have just been repeats of the same. Combine this with potential financial and roommate issues and I feel like my time is coming to it's end. I can't put my parents through the embarrassment of having a trans child that also dropped out of school and the stress of academics is tearing me apart physically and mentally. This summer I had the opportunity to throw myself off the dam near my college. I sat there at the top for nearly 4 hours. It would've looked like a fishing accident and saved my family so much embarrassment from my failures. I wish I would have done it. Now the plan is to intentially crash my car into a tree on a particularly rainy night so it looks like an accident. Until then I'll pretend everything is fine. My name is Zairen and I use they/them pronouns. I'm a 2nd year Csci student, a DJ Training Director, and my time is coming to an end.",suicide

I will fear they will leave or cheat on me. Now I'm second guessing all of my friendships. Maybe they don't really like me. Maybe they'll break up with me, and im just a lamb waiting to be slaughtered. 
 
 I will never find someone. I just cannot. Not even a friendship, they always fail. I don't know what's wrong with me. I just keep getting hurt.

Right now, Iâ€™m not doing well and Iâ€™m in a really low place and am trying to find some outlet that wonâ€™t scare and worry my friends and family.
 
 Iâ€™ve hit a breaking point and new rock bottom in the last 7 years of depression and anxiety (now knowing it as bipolar disorder with a recent diagnosis) one month ago. My post isnâ€™t a full as synopsis of everything and can never really be in a short post and may jump around.
 
 My now ex girlfriend and I had dated exactly one year when she told me she emotionally cheated on me for three months with one of her coworkers and made out with him when they got drunk one night. Now, Some of my best friends got married this week where my ex was the maid of honor. I had a conversation with my ex before the wedding letting her know I wanted to be friends still and to get anything that might set either of us off out of the way for our friends to have their day. (many advise no on the friends with the ex, especially in this situation, but I still care about her as a person and know she is a good person that has fucked up). I miss my relationship more than I miss her as a romantic partner, and just want my friendship that I have/had with her to remain. I donâ€™t have many friends left around me. 
 
 The night before their wedding, I got a text from my sister saying my dad had gone to the hospital and didnâ€™t say much more than that. My sisters and my parents are the only blood family I have that cares anything for me, and my parents had stopped talking to me since my recent diagnosis of Bi-Polar disorder. (They donâ€™t understand it, and Donâ€™t believe I am and think Iâ€™m chasing something that doesnâ€™t exists) . The next morning I tried to prop myself up for my friends wedding, being happy for them and trying to forget my problems to be able to. But I wasnâ€™t able to.
 
 I feel so guilty and ashamed of myself, but After drinking a little much I pushed my ex too far asking if she still wanted to be friends and if she was ok at the celebration after their wedding. (Beating the dead horse as we both promised not to do) And told her I donâ€™t think being friends will ever work. I knew I fucked up immediately and left the wedding and drove home. I abandoned and ran away from all the family I had at their wedding. (My friends and fraternity brothers). 
 
 All this is too much for me right now; with the added fact Iâ€™ve changed myself for other people to please and keep them around like my ex and family. I also followed my ex to an area and got a job that I donâ€™t find meaningful or fulfilling. And the fact I lost all sense of accomplishment and fulfillment in activities I used to love. I lead myself down a self destructive trail in the pursuit of what I thought would make me whole. I know now that itâ€™s a problem I need to work on.
 
 Iâ€™ve sent an apology to my ex and my friends today to try to mend things a little. I donâ€™t know how they feel, but I can imagine it hurts, is frustrating and an annoyance they didnâ€™t need. 
 
 I promised everyone around me I would never kill myself, That it would magnify the pain Iâ€™m feeling and put it on to them. Iâ€™m just so unstable right now even on medication, therapy, and exercise. I know I can reach out to my friends for support and donâ€™t want to burden them. Iâ€™m just so afraid, and lonely right now. I donâ€™t want to die, but death is looking more and more favorable. I just want the unnecessary guilt and pain to go away.

835,"My step father is repeatedly telling me that he's going to divorce my mother because of him having to provide for me. I feel like suicide is the only option as I can't support her or myself.I suffer from severe depression and anxiety among other problems that I'd rather not go into detail about that prevents me from functioning in nearly any social circumstance, and my family has been in poverty for a long time. I've tried to get a job several times only to not be considered after an interview on the phone or otherwise.
 
 Understandably, my parents and step dad find this hard to bear. My mom is sad over my condition but handles it. The fact of that matter is that, I'm a leech. On society, but mostly for my parents which work to support me.
 
 Recently, my step-dad has been threatening me, personally, with divorce (divorcing my mom, so to speak).
 
 He makes it expressly clear that it is MY fault, and my fault alone. While my mom is less confrontational, she's essentially said similar things to me i.e. ""Me and X will divorce only because of you""
 
 I've had suicidal thoughts for a long time now, but have always been grounded by the belief that there were people around me who loved me.
 
 Except now everyobdy is sick. My dad is threatening to leave my Mom because of me, ruining her financially for the rest of her life, putting her in a cardboard box hungry on the streets of some city as a homeless 60 year old woman, my girlfriend routinely reminds me that she hates me and wants me to die, my Mom cries and has stress induced back pain every night. I can hear her crying through the wall.
 
 I am causing their lives to fall apart. And I don't know what do. ""Get a job"", ""Put soem effort into it"", ""Fix your life"". Well drugs aren't fixing it, motivation isn't fixing it, discipline isn't fixing it.
 
 I have no drive, I have no use, I make life worse for everybody around me, and I'm a leech financially. 
 
 I just want to die. It's not selfish anymore. IT's not petty. If I die now, I can break my Moms heart, but I can save her financial future. A mentally broken hobo is worse than a heartbroken woman that is being provided her. A girl with baggage is better than a girl who is with somebody she despises. A guy is better off working one job instead of two to support a disabled fuckwit.
 
 I'm just desperately hoping for a branch to fall onto.

889,"Week 1 of grad school and I'm already a failureI started grad school last week. I was so excited and prepared, already having chapter 1 of each textbook read and detailed notes in my notebook. While I anticipated grad school to be challenging, especially when I work a full time job, I did not expect this quarantine to make things 200x harder.
 
 I thought working as a kindergarten teacher from home would allow me more free time after work to focus on my classes. Instead, I'm being buried in emails from school directors and from parents. I have to send 36 emails every Monday with homework packets, in addition to making 36 phone calls every day to check in on parents and log their feedback onto an excel spreadsheet for the school directors to see. I also have to make PowerPoints and lesson plans daily, and teach live zoom classes spread out throughout each day, along with attending morning teacher meetings.
 
 With all this extra work and stress of parent complaints (because of course they are NEVER satisfied with the work we're putting in for their kids), my anxiety has been through the roof. This has made it extremely difficult for me to focus on my schoolwork, as I'm constantly exhausted and feel too anxious about my work not being good enough, so I've struggled to make it through my discussion board posts and short papers. I procrastinated because I'm a fucking dumbass, and get too stuck in my own head and anxiety over not being smart enough for grad school. Because of this, I waited til the last minute to type my paper and wound up turning it in at 12:31am. It had been due at 11:59pm. I had no idea that, even though all the discussion posts and replies I posted were on time (days before the deadline; I *only* procrastinated the paper bc I was so stupidly scared of doing a shit job), failure to turn in this paper would result in automatic withdrawal from the class. My other online class is fine, I have an A. But now thats my only class, which means its going to take me even longer to graduate and I'm going to be a fucking underpaid kindergarten teacher forever. I'm never going to get my PsyD because I'm a fucking moron who can't manage her time and swallow her stupid fucking mental issues for important shit like this. Its almost 5am and I've been trying to calm myself down for the past 2 hours; I finally found this place to vent to. I hope that's okay. My cat is with me so I'm not going to hurt myself.

 Iâ€™m only 27 and I married the wrong man. I donâ€™t love him. We are not compatible. I tried to leave him before and start a new, but he tried to kill himself and begged to come back. I cut off all ties but he found me anyway. I took him back and it was the biggest mistake of my life. Now were married. I refuse to procreate with him. Iâ€™m not dragging other human life into my misery. He says he loves me and he cares, but his insecurities and esteem make it impossible for us to coexist.
 
 His debt is following me. They found my number. Collectors call every day. I answered the call one time because I did not realize that it was a collector. My husband became extremely upset with me for answering the call. He said that I made everything worse because they know how to contact us now. I donâ€™t answer my phone at all anymore.

 Currently: age - 26, male, live alone with dog, no friends, one psychologist/therapist, diagnosed with- depression, ADHD, anxiety, type 1 diabetes 
 
 Backstory: 6 years college - dropped out, many psychologists and therapists, many different diagnoses, choleric temperament - hard to work with, upper? middle class, white, extreme guilt of not living to potential
 
 5 years ago I broke down in college and basically stopped everything. I hated myself and everyone. I was angry, frustrated and sad. As the years progressed I became more isolated. As of now I have maybe one friend I talk to on facebook who moved away a year ago. I have no job, I dislike speaking to my parents, and I really only go out at night when I take my dog out for a walk. I guess I also talk to my psychologist, he is the only one I have ever not hated.
 
 It seems that the only way to change ones predicament is to want to change. My parents have money, I am not in jail, and I am relevantly smart. I know depression causes a lack of motivation and all that, but it's not just that. When I would get a job (a shitty one) I would become quickly bored. I never last more than a month and usually I do something I'm not supposed to do before I quit - crash company's servers, make people angry at me ect. I am told I have the potential to be smart, but then everything I do is wrong. I basically have to have my hand held to do anything correctly and it takes me many tries to learn to do anything and I am completely bored. 
 
 I know people with depression and other mental illnesses have a hard time seeing their life in a clear light. There is a fog that we supposedly cannot penetrate even though we believe we can. I believe I can and the one thing I do with all my time is research and read textbooks, articles and studies on illnesses and general philosophies. Am I right? I am sure I am not, though I have a really hard time trusting other people when their view differs from mine.
 
 Anyway, I see my lack of motivation. But it isn't because I feel like I can't do things. I have done things, but I forget them so quickly I have to relearn them over and over. Usually I can do something once and then I lose the motivation to do it again. 
 
 A solution people come up with is not to get disillusioned by failure. If you ask out one girl and get rejected then ask out 100 until someone says yes, but that isn't the problem. The problem is I am so extremely lonely, but the girls I see I hate. I don't want a gf, I don't want real friends and then I am stuck in this world I made of utter, complete loneliness that I don't want either, but it is a lot easier to handle. My majors in college became boring as I was studying them, I couldn't keep going on. I always felt like I wasn't learning well enough. I would forget what I learned the year before and feel lost even though I had ok grades. I always felt like people were judging me so I never connected with students and eventually I would quit just like all of my jobs and the few girls who did go out with me a couple of times. I always end everything and it seems my cutoff point is about a month. 
 
 I feel this insane guilt of doing nothing for society and taking so many of its resources to keep me alive. My fear of death makes it so that I am constantly trying to find the best medical help. I worry about every pain and problem with my body. I don't want to die, but I feel as if I am too broken to be fixed and that death is this only thing left for me. There is this schism in me where I am cocky, independent, egotistical, unique ect and then there is this other part of me that has no confidence, needs babying, scared and obviously unoriginal. There is no bipartisanship between any of my feelings so I can get something done and leave this horrid place. I don't trust anyone, not even myself, but then I judge myself by everyone's advice and what I believe. When I am alone I wish I wasn't, and when I am with company I wish I was alone. I fear death and yet I wish for it constantly. I wish people would do stuff for me, and when they do I become incensed that they would do such a thing. I get a gf, a job, a school and think immediately about leaving. 
 
 Anyone who used to care about me, I think, has long given up. Everyone except myself and the psych who I pay loads of money to. I think they gave up half because it was confusing and half because what I say made no sense and so I became untrustworthy. I would have conversations where someone would suggest something and I would say I couldn't do it. They would try to help and I would say no thanks I can do it myself. I can see how it makes no sense and yet, I still understand how both things I said were completely true.

925,"This is my experience on thinking about suicide and being dobbed in so that my workplace gets involved - part 4This has just happened to me today.
 
 Staying home from work and I got an email from work that just made me go ""bitch - pleeassseee""
 
 Work conflicts basically caused me to become mentally ill to the point that when I get frustrated with them, self harm thoughts come hand in hand with any irritation or anger. 
 
 It's not that I plan to kill myself, but instantaneously I think in my head ""I want to kill myself"" and immediately next thought I would think ""OMG don't be stupid, that's not going to happen"". That sort of goes backwards and forth until I get very worked up. It feels crazy in my head and it feels I need to vent. 
 
 The problem here is now I don't really care about anything asides from basically bitching to someone. 
 
 What happened today was I bitched to a ""friend"" at work (via my personal email and their work email). I do say ""friend"" because I'm not venting to them because it's my best friend or anything - it is someone who I know personally from work and knows about other instances I thought about self harm at work... and isn't very trustworthy (as you are about to find out)
 
 I bitch a bit and told him what I was thinking at that moment, which had bits of people are lying to me again, I want to kill myself, I feel faint... so forth. (Not the first time I told him that - in fact I told him I locked myself in the bathroom at work because I got scared I'll self harm if I went outside... and he did nothing. Literally nothing. He read it and didn't even check that I was alright or not or come to check on me - I was literally just upstairs. Anyways, the point of that side story is that this is normal).
 
 So back to the main story. I wrote those emails early in the morning, then went home and watched some TV and went to sleep. 
 
 After lunch, my parents started phoning me up saying work contacted them and work phoned the police. 
 
 OK sure. Not the first time work phoned the police on me and fuck them. 
 
 The police came. What they knew was: Work has phoned them telling them that I sent an email saying I'd self harm / suicide and they were worried because I haven't sent them anything since so they have not been in contact and they were worried if I was alive.
 
 They have mixed in some truths with lies. I sent an email, true. The bit where they make a big deal out of it, a lie. (I had no phone calls or emails from them that day - really they could've contacted me if they wanted to. However they did phone both my parents who said they were in contact with me and did not want them to phone the police and make a big deal out of it)
 
 The point is, I was fine. I got taken to hospital for a check up and got let out the same day, so the doctors didn't think there were reasons to keep me there even though they could've done so against my will. 
 
 There are going to be people who hide behind a facade of ""care"" or ""worry"" who says they are doing things that they are not. It's hard to tell (most people want to be loved so they want to believe what they are being told is true), but when you feel worse after hearing about it then something isn't right. It's just better to trust your instincts. People can let you down or betray your trust.
 
 I'm slowly getting used to people who think they can mix in some lies because people would believe them over someone like me (someone with a history of mental illness / seen a psychologist). 
 Those stories might be enough to send the police to your place and have you sent to hospital for an assessment, but the police literally can't do anything else - it's the doctors who decide. Doctors at the hospital aren't going to just blindly listen to that ""story"", and going to the hospital doesn't mean that they'll keep you there against your will.
 
 Why did my work place decide to lie? I don't know. They could be genuinely worried, they could be covering their ass in case of legal problems or they could want to put me in my place for being a nuisance. It really doesn't matter. They can say you are mental but they are just as mental as themselves.
 
 As for my ""friend"". I am still coping with the fact that he would care more about the company than my wellbeing. I honestly do believe if I died he'd shrug it off. I've told him I was feeling suicidal endless amounts of times before, but getting personal messages (like whatsapp not just emails) forward off to work? Part of not being about to cope makes me think about self harm, want to kill myself, wanting them to watch me die, wanting him to regret not helping me. What gets to me the most is that he pretends he is above fault. I had a panic attack in front of him and he walked away telling me I should get help. He did that more than once actually. At the same time, he's pretending he's a good guy who cares and will help when shit hits the fans. He is like a human version of the workplace. If I can kill myself, I'd make sure he gets haunted by it.

What should I do to cheer him up? My kid is a junior in college (without a car on campus) and will probably not be able to see us (his parents) for his 21st birthday due to COVID. Usually, we celebrate his birthday a week later because his birthday is a week before his school goes on spring break. This year he has no spring break, or any break that he would usually come home for. 
 
 He hasnâ€™t had the best roommates when it comes to celebrating his birthday with him. Freshman yea he didnâ€™t have a roommate 2nd semester. Sophomore year he had a roommate who was controlling and didnâ€™t let him watch tv on his (roommates) tv at all and had to be quiet after 8:00 pm.

936,"Suicide watch after a DUI arrest.I was referred to this subreddit, and it is highly applicable.
 
 I don't mean to deflect, but I'm asking for a friend. He's a great guy, simply he carries a lot of baggage.
 
 Some context to the current question: My friend is a former member of the armed forces for the United States of America. His experience was difficult to accept, and it's taken a toll on him psychologically. He previously was an excellent athlete, and now centralizes his lifestyle around marijuana, nicotine and alcohol.
 
 We both attend a university in a ""college town"" and returned from our spring break yesterday afternoon. Last night, he drove with blood alcohol concentration over 0.2. I received a call this morning from his father asking me to ensure he doesn't act drastically.
 
 Legal action will be required promptly, and I fear that the absence of his vehicle (impounded) will allow him to dwell in his thoughts to a fault. He owns quite a few guns, and his stability is my primary concern. I am staying at his household overnight, and he had some friends stop by throughout the day, yet I do not foresee this being a long-term fix. He has acknowledged the circumstances in a constructive manner, yet becomes frustrated when grasping the consequences of his actions.
 
 In closing, he has great character, solely the baggage he carries weighs him down to the point that he wants to quit his continuation and he perceived his actions last night as justification. I told him he should not define himself by one night, and I was hoping to acquire some knowledge from anyone with personal experience to better provide encouragement.

 I had started working at a company where I [30M] met K [30M]. We soon were best buddies and after a couple of months he confessed he was gay. Now, he is not the type of guy you would suspect he is gay. In fact, he is not out and he tries his best to keep it a secret. This is the source of a lot of frustration and stress in his life. A thing which most people will attribute to him being a shy person. Furthermore,hHe has never had a relationship and I am the only guy who knows. 
 
 He has his personal issues why he doesn't want to come out but mostly it is because he is not attracted to the type of guys you see in LGBT parades. However, I did manage to convince him to seek professional help which he still is continuing on getting.
 
 Honestly, when he first told me about his secret, I tried my best to be laid back about it. I continued to treat him as I would treat any best friend. Admittedly, I may have crossed the line occasionally by commenting 'love you' or 'xx'. I guess, from him end he was interpreting this as being more than just friends. However, I (naively) saw nothing wrong in that. 
 
 Thing is he does not believe that my intentions were honest and that I was never interested in him. Because of this, we have been constantly fighting and it has come to a point were I cannot mention my SO. He stopped going out with his friends and I am the only friend he goes out with. Whilst I enjoy his company, many times it feels like I have to take him out because he is so lonely. This is something I had always discouraged but was always helpless in avoiding.
 
 He is now treating to kill himself because he wants to see me since we are not meeting often. He always had suicidal thoughts but he is treating to do it since he has lost all the reason to live for since he does not have me any longer in his life. I am mortified because on one hand I wish to help him but on the other hand I know that I AM the problem. On one hand I wish to keep him in my life, but on the other hand I know that our friendship cannot go any longer like this. 
 
 One thing I failed to mention is that I have never spoke to my SO about this and this is also having serious repercussions on my conscience. I feel guilty because I am keeping such a secret from her but on the other hand I cannot break my promise to my friend.
 
 I honestly do not know what to do. Did I do something wrong?

 I have never been told that I don't look disabled. My disability is VISIBLE. I literally have a different face and body shape. On top of that, my grammar is so poor and my IQ is so low that even if I had the body shape of a mildly autistic woman, I would still get called retard if they talked to me.
 
 I don't have the empathy to understand why people are upset about people telling them they don't look disabled. It's a COMPLIMENT to me. It's telling me that I am normal looking and I am not retarded. Honestly why do people want to be told they look disabled?

 Here's my story. When I was 7 years old my cousins said they would watch me, but instead of doing that I was gang raped by 5 males and then a few months later I was molested by my sister. On top of that while I was growing up my brother/sister/dad would call me a fat piece of shit, a loser, the black sheep of the family, the family would be better off without me. I heard this shit as early as elementary school leading up to high school. My mom would also come home from work and beat me, tell me everything was my fault, and I'm just costing her money. When I was at school I would be picked on and bullied. I would get beaten up everyday, they would even tie of gym shirts and socks and beat me with them in front of the pe teachers. They stood there and did nothing to stop it! I never had a place where I would feel safe, I never had anyone to cry to or talk to. I've been a loner my entire life and the only friends I would have would steal from me and ditch me because I was too fat to be seen with by other people. The first time I opened up to someone was my first girlfriend and I had only known her for two weeks. I remember bawling in her arms while she gently stroked my hair. That was the most comforting moment of my life. Well, after awhile of that she got tired of it broke up with me and called me too much of a headache to be around.
 
 Since the day she broke up with me alll I've had ar my two best friends in the world. And then disowned me as a friend recently because they are very religious and all they could do to cheer me up is tell me to be live in God and I would usually just nod my head ok. I recently told them that I would appreciate it if they wouldn't bring up God anymore and they said if you can't accept him then we have nothing else to say to you. They won't return my calls or text anymore. Now I have no one. I've been laying in bed everyday untill I have to go to work then when I get off I just sleep untill work again.

1049,"TrappedHello to anyone so kind as to read this and listen to my troubles. You are truly a wonder to hear out any suicidal person. 
 I'm at the end of my rope. Severe depression and anxiety have plagued me since I was 10, and I am now 26. Grew up in an abusive home and developed agoraphobia that, in tandem with my other mental illnesses, rules my life. To give an idea of how bad my anxiety is, I failed classes because I was too scared to leave my seat to turn in my work. I was living for my childhood cat until she died a year and a half ago; an event I had long figured would mark my demise. I was ready to kill myself shortly after her passing, but in the days I spent in preparation, I met an amazing person, who is still my boyfriend. I get by for a year with a lot of his help, but then lose my job. That was six months ago. I move in with my boyfriend. We have horrid upstairs neighbors that consistently deprive me of sleep (insomnia is/was already an issue), so, before I know it, my days become entirely comprised of doing nothing but trying to sleep. 
 I'm scared to leave the house, but so miserable and constantly, incredibly stressed out from the neighbors that I feel completely trapped. I fear that dying is the only way out. I moved back in with my mom briefly but not having the daily companionship of my boyfriend saw my mental state unravel even worse than what the neighbors do to it. I would love to just run away and live in my car (was homeless once) but I'm dependent upon both my medication and, unfortunately, opiates. The opiates are to counteract a horrible thing called akathisia. I already tried killing myself due to this wretched disorder twice until opiates brought miraculous relief, though they're obviously a double-edged sword. I can't get off my meds, either, as that would undoubtedly end in suicide after experiencing my depression unleashed again.
 
 So I'm stuck with no job, a home I despise but am too scared to ever leave, a substance dependence that won't allow me any freedom that I'm not too afraid of, and zero future prospects... And this is a very general list. If I listed everything that is wrong in my head and my life, this post would be even more lengthy. I don't want to hurt my boyfriend or any of my family, but I can't keep this life up. 
 I thought I could get through today as long as I got to spend time with my boyfriend, but after waiting all week- an agonizing amount of time when you are desperate to die- he came home with a headache and had to go straight to bed. He works long tomorrow.

I have been in school for the past 15 years and I am just done with it. I am currently enrolled in college and I don't give a crap anymore. I already skipped classes on my first day, that's how much I care about getting a degree at this point. I want to drop out but I don't have anything else in life. I have no friends outside of my job that pays me shit, I don't have any talents or skills, I have no real world experience as I've been living in my parents basement for the past 3 or so years. If my parents kick me out I will end up as a homeless man on the street. I am worried they are going to kick me out. They have no reason to let me live here really once they find out I'm a liar. I have been lying to them about my grades just to buy myself a few more months of time I can spend browsing the internet and playing video games in the basement. I have absolutely no plans whatsoever for when they kick me out. I am well aware that a college degree is required to go anywhere in life, but sadly I don't really care. I don't learn anything from being in school, I have never been able to focus on schoolwork or find any motivation to do it for as long as I can remember. I've been terrible at school since 2nd grade, I doubt I'll get better in my 3rd year of college. I wish I had the willpower to make myself care about my grades, but I just simply don't.

I am starting to see less and less of a reason not to end my own life. I'm just going to be a asshole bum with no prospects living on the streets within 2 years anyway. The only thing keeping me from killing myself is that I still enjoy watching some TV shows and some video games, but even those haven't been enough to keep me happy these days. It's becoming harder and harder to entertain myself. Once my ability to actually enjoy things is gone, I'm killing myself. That doesn't seem too far off. Help.",suicide

 I need to get better. I need to get better. I need to get better. I'm really going to die. My body can't take the pain in my head any longer. I'm really going to die. There's nothing else left. It's only a matter of days, my heart will stop beating on its own. I don't know when I last lived. I don't know when I last felt happiness. I don't know when I last felt an emotion. I would like to be drunk to forget everything. I would like to drown myself in alcohol so I don't remember that I don't feel anything.
 
 No one can help me. It's too late, it was in December that I needed help. Now it's too late, I'm about to die. 
 
 Why am I alone?
 
 I remember when Ewen had his breakdown, and we were there for him. We talked about it in the class council, we made him go to the theatre with us, we invited him to parties, we checked on him at boarding school.
 
 But today, everyone has had their fill of misfortune. We can't be there to support the others anymore, we don't have the shoulders. I just wish I still had one friend. To have just one hug. And cry. I would like to cry. Sometimes I read something or hear music, and I want to cry, but I can't. If there is a god somewhere, I beg him to stop my agony. Whatever the way. Please. Please.",neutral

1068,"Yesterday I was talked out of suicide by my ex-boyfriend.I don't really know what to say here, I just feel like I need to get all this off of my chest. For the past couple of years thoughts of self harm and suicide have come and gone, even when I was in a really great place in life. Recently(the past few months) things have gotten worse for me. Multiple factors are piling up and it's starting to feel like it's entirely too much to handle. This past weekend I stayed at my ex's house and tonight when I got home something just changed, got worse somehow, and I just wanted to end it. I was actually going to do it. For some reason though, I spoke to him and he talked me out of it before he had to go to bed(he has school today), he wants me to get help but I can't afford to get any. He told me that he might ""turn me in"" which I think means tell someone at his school or the police or something about what I've been thinking of. I told him I'd never forgive him, and I can't handle my parents reactions if he did tell someone, but deep down I would give anything to have some help. I've told him for over a year now that I need help and I think he's just now starting to believe me. He told me he will get me help no matter what, but I'm so afraid of some authority figure finding out what I've been thinking of doing. I can't even talk to anyone face to face about it. I can barely talk to anybody about anything face to face. I'm not sure if I have social anxiety(the talking to people/being around people part), depression, both, or neither but I'm sure that I'm sick of my life being this way. I'm sick of existing and not living. I found this subreddit through MMFB(which I found through IAMA), and I just had to let it out somewhere where my face was unknown. I don't know if you've read this far, but if you have thank you. If you care for me to, I can try to keep this updated.
 Also, in case someone was wondering why I don't go to another friend for help instead of my ex, it's because my ex is literally the only friend I have. I had a clique that we both hung out with but I(stupidly) pushed them away.",suicide

1072,"K-2SO x L3-37 fan fiction (chill I wrote this half jokingly and it's all in good fun, no need for pitchforks) This takes place a good while after The Rise of Skywalker, and follows the idea that K-2SO downloads his memory to the other Imperial security droid from HISHE.
 
 K-2SO wakes up on a forest, surrounded by rusted and mossy debris of what looks like an Imperial ship. He stood and saw the tip of the old Rebel base, which has been largely devastated after an attack by The Empire. He wanders for a bit before finding what looks like a freighter.
 
 ""A Correlian YT-1300 light freighter, what is it doing here?"" He said to himself.
 
 He stopped before walking any further as he sees that the base is no longer operational and came to two conclusions, The Empire won and wiped the Rebel Alliance or an escape was made right after a large battle. A large hairy figure spotted him as well as what seemed to be a droid model he's unfamiliar with. The figure was carrying a bowcaster and the droid was rolling around as his body was shaped like a ball.
 
 ""Do not shoot, I mean you no harm!"" K-2SO shouted, ""I am not part of the Empire despite what my appearance would tell you.""
 
 The figure shrieks and K-2SO found out that it was a wookie.
 
 ""It may be impolite of me, but I do not understand Shyriiwook."" He exclaimed in a half joking manner.
 
 One thing led to another and after a ripped arm caused by a Wookie tantrum, he was allowed to enter the freighter named The Millenium Falcon as well as the name of the Wookie (Chewbacca) with the rolling droid (BB-8) being his translator. He found out that they are there to wait for a Jedi named Rey who went and take a look at the base as a part of learning the Jedi's past. The other two were quick to accept him as the rebel database mentions a suicide mission including a reprogrammed Imperial droid that might or might not survived the battle at Scarif. Everything was going well until the Falcon was attacked by a jungle Rancor. They rushed inside and make quick work with the large beast, but with some significant damage to the ship, and BB-8 said to him that it would be nice if he would help to fix the ship.
 
 ""I no longer have a master, might as well made myself useful."" He replied.
 
 After a scan it turns out that the navigation computer system was damaged a bit on the attack, and he chose to fix that first as it seemed to be the quickest one to repair. He soon realized that the navigation system is like nothing he ever seen with some of the most peculiar dialect. He's interested in what seemed to be self awareness as he never seen another droid expressed such way of thinking for a navigation system. He proceeds to connect the computer to his head using a cable to interact with it in a more face to face way.
 
 ""My name is K-2SO, I just fix the navigation computer and now I am interested in the self awareness of this system."" He exclaimed to the abyss.
 
 ""You, you're like me!"" A faint sound of a female is heard.
 
 ""I am sorry, I do not know what you're talking about and I know the difference between a droid and a navigation system."" He replied.
 
 ""I am L3-37, I am a droid own- who was a partner of Lando Calrissian, and had been this ship's navigation computer for most of my existence, I am disgusted on how I and droids across the galaxy is treated,"" The voice said, ""and you showed up having the same level of awareness as me!"" She continued.
 
 ""I am sorry to inform you but my self awareness comes from the result of my reprogramming and I'm sure that you achieved the same thing from a similar method,"" He answers ""it is not true awareness.""
 
 ""Oh it's awareness alright, the way you decided to fix me first without asking the only living thing on this ship, the way you decided to plug yourself in without other people telling you to, as well as your distinct personality."" L3 replied.
 
 ""That is not true, I was.... taking initiative by my own.... I see your point."" He said.
 
 They chatted for a good while and even went into a heated argument about droid rights, but ended up passive aggressivelly agreeing with each other's views.
 
 ""Hey, thanks for fixing me, and talking to me, it's been a long time since I get to talk to another person."" She said.
 
 ""Do not mention it, I plug myself into this ship and I have no one to blame but myself for getting berated by another droid."" He replied.
 
 ""Shut up!"" She said in a sarcastic tone, ""promise me that you'll send my message to droids across the galaxy."" She continued.
 
 ""I do not see how they could have self awareness from your message as the chance of that happening is at most 0.62016%, but I will send them to other droids."" He assured her.
 
 He unplugged himself from the computer.
 
 ""Well now I have job to do."" He said to himself.",neutral
1073,"I feel like im wasting time.
 First off im sorry how scrambled this is. I cant think straight. 
 
 Im a 22 year old male, i have been depressed for quite awhile now. It comes and goes and i dont know where it came from. I lost my brother in a car accident when i was 18 and he was 19 just a month shy of 20. I feel like that is probably the main factor but it doesnt seem like it on the surface. 
 
 I have many issues and i dont know what to do tho. I have no career paths, i have no money saved.... I love music and i am pretty good at it and a lot of people in my city are into what i do, but i just cant write music like i used to. I will work for 15 hrs a day and get nothing, Not only that but i just feel i have no time anymore. I work full time and i also play video games a lot which i love, i never go outside, i never see friends. I see my girlfriend and thats it, and really all we do is watch tv and stay in bed. I want to say its her fault because she doesnt have any hobbies, she relys on me super heavily and if im not with her shes mad. As fucked up as it sounds i still adore her. Shes gained weight and that effects her mental state and 7 years she still wont show me her nude body. Theres just so much and i dont know what to do. Where to go with my life and i feel its eating my insides to where im done.... im good at a lot but im not good enough. The one girl i love treats me poorly and wont even get comfortable with me enough to show me herself. I hate my family even tho they have done so much for me and treat me well, i just think they are robotic and i cant stand being with them. 
 
 I cant even fucking write properly, i see this post is allover the place but i just need to vent. I dont wanna kill myself because i know what death does to people. I may relieve myself but in doing that i hurt my friends and family and my girlfriend. 
 
 I just dont know where to go from here. I want music to work out but i would lose my girlfriend. I want my girlfriend to work out but ill lose my music. I cant do both cause i feel u dont have enough time in a day. Im lost. Im sad. Im happy when i take drugs. Im happy when i drink. Im not a druggie or an alcoholic. I just i feel nothing anymore.

I understand that, and respect her choice but can do nothing but be heartbroken. I had feelings for her for the last FIVE years, but was too afraid to tell her.

1082,"Last NightLast night I spent some of the last of my money at the bar getting blackout drunk. I talked about football with this random guy. I talked about first downs and special teams while I was choking back tears. I got to that sweet part of the night where I went cross eyed. I was seeing double of everything and I had a pounding headache. I decide to engage in this self sabotaging behavior because I want to make it easier to finally end my life. I get drunk and kill off the microscopic bit of hope I have, so I have nothing to cling to when considering suicide. I sat at the bar, almost falling off the stool, and it really hit me this time. I really could kill myself tonight. I always wondered what it would feel like to finally go over the edge, what would your own brain sound like in the moment where you became ok with dying. Was it peaceful, was it scary, was it just somewhere in between? What it is, is the feeling, that beyond a shadow of a doubt, you would not feel the consequences of suicide, because you will be dead. All of my friends? My family? If I had the choice I would end my life without hurting them, but in reality I won't exist, it won't effect me, it will be....nothing. I silently decided, ""ok, I think tonight is the night"".
 
 I stood up, turned to the guy I was talking to, smiled and told him to have a great night. He gave me a drunken pat on the back and said ""ok you too"", and I left. My first thought was ""are you ok with that guy being the last human being you talk to""? And immediately, I thought yes. Who cares. It's all symbolic horse shit that won't mean anything after I'm dead. It's the same nonsense that makes people want to have their ashes scattered at the beach, and that's never been me, so why should I care. I left the bar, and just started......walking. I didn't know where I was going, but I really hoped the courage to end it was at my destination. I walked through downtown Tucson for a bit. I started looking at all these beautiful college kids at the clubs and bars, all with a major, a plan, a path. I've never really envied them, or at least I never thought walking their path would make me happier, but my whole life was spent trying to rationalize how me and all of them could have such wildly different journeys on this planet, for better or for worse. Last night though, I couldn't help but find the humor in it. Everyone of them that saw me walk passed probably assumed I was someone, that I went to school somewhere, that I had an identity outside of being nobody. It made me think about how there's probably plenty of people I see, actively contemplating their death, that just blend in like me. It made me think, even if it were just for a second, to reconsider what I aimed to do that night.
 
 I thought about it for a second. I thought about just going home and sleeping it off and keeping on keeping on in the morning. Then I remembered, I already made my choice. I didn't sabotage my chances at the future so I could back out now. I intended to do what I've known needed to be done since I was 16.
 
 I kept walking, and walking, and walking. I walked past a gas station with a cigarette ad in the window. I thought about what a shame it was that I quit smoking for my health. I thought about how now, in retrospect, I should of eaten Mcdonalds and chocolate cake everyday. I should of done Heroin and every other drug under the sun. I thought about how tame my life was because there was a tomorrow to live for. At this I was out of downtown and well into the outskirts of Tucson. It was about 12AM at this point.
 
 I finally reached a highway. It wasn't like an interstate, more like a 3 lane avenue that has a sidewalk running alongside it. I'd see these 18 wheelers come buy at 65 MPH. Upon seeing this, I could feel almost muscle spasms in my knees that were willing me to jump in front of one of these things. I thought about it for a second. What if I jump and they swerved and caused an accident? What if it killed other people but not me? I couldn't bring myself to do it for that reason.
 
 I continued walking down the highway. Even though I wasn't gonna jump in front of one of these cars, everyone that passed filled my head with visuals of me splattered all of the road. I walked until I saw a park 
 
 I don't know what possessed me, but I just entered the park with no intention. I spotted a bench and threw myself in to it. I leaned over the side and vomited, then I passed out. I woke up 2 hours later with an awful headache. Something about the way I felt just told me I had missed my chance to end my life. I knew that the state I was in before I passed out was my opportunity to finally have the balls to do it, and I let it slip away. I don't know when I'll ever be able to capture it again.

1083,"I'm invisibleGranted I'm known by many acquaintances but have zero friends. I am often repeating myself because so called friends don't listen or dont hear me or frankly, don't give a shit. I've been suffering from bipolar disorder, manic depression, for upwards of 18 years. I told myseld if I could just make it past 27 yrs things would get better. I've been hospitalized, most recently in September 2019, the staff basically said they don't treat us but just monitor us until we are stable on meds and fit to leave. I have no family, raised in the foster care system and I'm completely alone. I don't see the point in living anymore if I'm constantly in mental agony or being ignored or used on every level. I've taken care of people I thought were friends because I have so much love to give but misguided as usual I end up used and thrown out like a tissue or ignored blatantly. I can't keep a job so my stability is often rocked by my own uncontrollable emotions and outbursts and I can't cope anymore. I'm losing hope and honestly just would like someone to acknowledge that I am alive and a sensitive but real person. Even then I don't know how to curb the feelings and thoughts of suicide. My closest friends growing up have all passed, either by suicide or excessive drug use I'm honestly debating the same path because without them I'm more alone than ever. 
 Idk if reddit is the place for this but at the very least I'm getting this out and have one outlet to speak on my real feelings.

I was able to deal with this thanks to the help of my girlfriend at the time but we broke up 2 months ago. This is when it all came crashing down. I felt I lost the only person I could trust with these issues, she was the only person who didn't judge me for it. We were together for over 3 years and she moved on within a week to new guy who she likes to tell me how he is terrible yet super good looking (that makes me feel awful). A few weeks after we broke up, my step mother gave me no choice but to move out of my father's to live with my grandparents. I had some friends over playing board games (they both knew this and gave me permission) when she came storming into the house drunk screaming at me for forgetting to turn the porch light on (every other light by that door was on). I was sick of the constant mental abuse I received from her and how she treated my younger sibling so I packed up my things and moved out that night.

 1. I played minecraft for 8.5 hours today. My siblings were annoyed because I wanted be in my room alone because I was on a vc.
 
 2. One of my friends used a bunch of slabs to build a bridge from the top of a mountain down to the ground.
 
 3. A different friend gave everyone flower pots with flowers planted in them. I got 2, a Lily of the Valley and an Azure Bluet. He has a very wholesome personality and thats my favorite part about him.
 
 4. The same friend kept getting called a massive weeb by his twin brother, because he would talk about anime, even though his brother would correct him on every small inaccuracies he would say.
 
 5. The same friend from 3 and 4 said ""when you put a pokemon in the daycare, it would make them horny. Who goes to daycare to be horny?"" 
 
 6. The same friend called drowns ""pickaxe munchkins"" and ""angry boys"" when he got attacked by them.
 
 7. A different friend decided to tuck the boys into bed with pink carpet. 
 
 8. The friend who tucked the boys into bed created what we call pride sheep by having every color of sheep in a pen in our home area (except for the one guy in the mountains with the bridge).
 
 9. I was the 2nd person to find diamonds but the first to mine them (the first was flower pot guy in a village chest), and I got to make the nether portal. So thats cool. I died in the nether tho.

Maybe I'm ugly, maybe he's just turned off by me, maybe maybe maybe. He would always say he didnt know why he just wouldnt make a move. I was always the one to do it first. 
 
 Today, he finally told me that my depression and anxiety, living with it, has turned him off. He prefaced by saying he knows it wasn't my fault and that he knows I've been trying. He was also hesitant to speak on it out of fear of hurting my feelings. 
 
 Here I am now, feelings hurt. I feel devastated, like a part of me, the hope I had that I could fix this has died. I've been on and off different medications. I've been to therapy. I've been trying. But nothing matters. My work doesnt matter. I dont matter.
 
 So now I'm here alone in my bed. Crying my eyes out to the point of exhaustion. I want to die. The only person keeping me here today is my mother. I know my death would break her heart...

 Credit: u/potheadboyz
 
 
 So I have a super weird kink. I like my women a bit on the insane side. To be more specific, it turns me on if a girl holds a knife to my neck (in a joking way of course, interpret that how you will) it turns me on especially if we're making out or having sex. Also kinda turns me on if she treats me like property, like I belong to her (now I don't mean she uses me as a wallet). I know this is an unrealistic kink and there is no one in the world like this but it's something I fantasize about. Probably one of the weirdest kinks ever.

1136,"I'm nothing and I won't have anything enjoyable in my life.Firstly, I'm sorry for my bad English but I'm not a native speaker. 
 
 So, I'm 18 years old boy and I've been planning to commit suicide for couple of months. I would probably do it already, if not the fact, that I doesn't want to hurt my mother and my friend. 
 
 Maybe you're wondering why such a young lad like me is willing to do that. Well, I would rather ask: Why shouldn't I? There is no happiness for me, now or in the future. I think every person consciously or unconsciously is seeking for happiness, so what's the point of living where there is no hope for me, to be a happy man. I don't know if happiness isn't destined for me or I just not capable enough to reach it, but does it really matter? There's is not a good thing waiting for me, period.
 
 Everyone perceive happiness as a different thing. For me, happiness comes from social interactions and from making different people happy. It may sound a little bit ironic, considering the fact, that I have to cope with terrible anxiety, general akwardness and introversion. Maybe that's the reason why I want to commit suicide, happiness for me, comes from a thing that I'm not able to do. 
 
 I was thinking about becoming an writer. That's a way, right? People will enjoy my books and everything will be fine. Well, there's the problem, I'm not good enough, to make it work. Although I enjoy writing, what's the fucking point, if it doesn't reach wider public?
 
 Secondly, I know it my sound kind of cheesy, but I don't think I can reach happiness without having a girlfriend. And, for me, having someone like that is not, almost impossible, it is just impossible. There are various reasons for that:
 
 \- I'm ugly and overweight
 
 \- I'm shy and introvertic
 
 \- I'm bad at having conversations
 
 \- I'm kind of a weirdo (I don't like generic music and stuff)
 
 \- etc.
 
 It is so painful for me that no women will ever love me, it's so fucking painful, man. And it's really not about sex, I don't give a fuck about sex, I can quickly jerk off and all of my lust is gone. It's about love and everything that comes with that.
 
 For the end I'm just gonna say, wish me, that someday I will gain enough braveness to finally jump off the bridge.",suicide

 So, a little while after my ex broke up with me (Early september I belive) I went to a whatssapp group with a friend of mine and met this girl, who I fell in love with a few days passed, we were dating, and it turns out that she talks about some +18 stuff, and then, my mom (Who is kinda a little bot too much religious) Saw one of those conversations about +18 stuff and took away my phne and almost killed me, beacuse You know Â¨I shouldn't be thining that kind of stuff beacuse I am too youngÂ¨ (Altho my ex friends used to talk about +18 stuff everywhere and got nudes out of a girl once) Also, I wanna make something clear as a glass block behind another glass block in Minecraft: I know the risk of online dating, beacuse you might not know if behind that screen there isn't any beautyfull 14yo girl and there is instead a 36yo guy called Chuck, who will eventually convince you to meet behind a dumpster at 3:00am so he can kidnap you and eventually sell your kidneys on the dark web, butI know perfectly that my gf is really who she says, beacuse we sent photos of eachother very often, we made phone calls, and we even thought of videocalls.
 
 A few weeks passed after that and I couldn't do anything, and I found an old phone that I had, so I installed messenger to it and went with her, why? Beacuse I love her, she is the only one that understood me and she never desserted me and she is the only one that supported everything that I do, fast forward like two days ago, my mom found out that I was still talking with my gf and took my other phone away, yes, she was still talking about +18 stuff but not that frecuently, they even insulted her, something that I cannot take, they didn't even read how she supported me, they also saw one time where she told me to love my body (I had low self-steem) and they made fun of it and they wont listen to me when I try to tell them that she is not just a horny teenager. 
 
 And here is where the title runs in, my mother told me that I will go to theraphy later this month, so, I know that they won't listen to me, but they will listen a theraphist, so when the right moment comes, I will talk about how they are basically judge a book by it's cover so they realise that she isnt what they think, and idk if it will work, what do you think?",neutral

1213,"Regimental Schooling This week for me was going great. I came home Saturday evening after a 5 hour drive South from my home feeling confident after taking my SAT. I had a somewhat relaxed Sunday and finished all the work I had to and prepared for a somewhat busy week. 
 
 However i didn't know that Monday would be probably the worst Monday of my life. 
 
 Of course, Mondays are bad. The feeling of going to work, to school, stating 5 days of &lt;insert something negative&gt;. However a grade came in for me, a 65% on an exam for my AP US History class. To give context on this, I go to a pretty competitive public highschool and I am currently a Junior. We had written an in-class DBQ (a special kind of US History essay format) as a test finishing our unit and as a kind of prep for the AP exam this year. I was kinda cruising at a 89.98, and the next minor assignment would have pushed my grade to a borderline A-, and I was kinda pumped.
 
 The grade came in before my period started, and I guess u could say I was a little shocked. I am not an extremely over-performing top 0.1% student, but I manage to get good grades. As literally everyone else in my class, I took to the group chat with everyone in the class. From the conversation, everyone was getting somewhere in the range 50-75%. Nobody got over an 85.
 
 When class started, our fatass of a teacher explained her reasoning behind the grading, as she was using the AP grading scale. If you are not familiar with the AP grading scale, you only need like a 70% raw score in the multiple choice, free-response, essay section etc. combined to get a 5/5 on the exam. So basically she graded without partial credit, no mercy. Everyone in the class was shocked. By everyone, I mean everyone, even the teacher's kissass pet. Her justification behind this was **""It is a realization and a wakeup call to prepare for the AP Exam. If you got over a 70% you will do great (5/5) on the AP Exam!""** If I was this close to a 5/5, why didn't I get the 100/100, or even the 80/100 (4/5)? This was the frustration for many other students. the teacher might think our overall grades are amazing, but literally nobody else on the planet would consider an 84% reasonable.
 
 I talked with the boys on the discord VC after school, and those in APUSH said their grades dropped by 5%, as did mine. Now it is barely recoverable, and the teacher probably screwed over everyone else and their future GPA's as well. Everyone I knew to have As in the class (pretty much everyone) no longer had it. Not only is this a significant drop in a statistic, it is a huge drop in morale. HUGE. I worked my ass off so far to have one unfairly graded exam drop it to a grade I have never observed to be so low in my life. My grade is so low, and it can barely be recovered, what is the point of even trying in the class anymore? Is there a purpose at all? In anything?
 
 If you think that the 84% is actually not bad, I respect that, but I would also like to reiterate that I live i an extremely competitive, stressful area where A's are nearly mandated by parents and Colleges.
 
 TLDR: The teacher's irreversible and regimental grading policy for this one exam has quite literally screwed over every student in APUSH this year, and everyone's future with a trashy GPA. The system is pretty fucked NGL.

1223,"British school lunches ""Thy nourishment is thy sustenance"" â€” William Shakespeare
 
 Not only is the food served at my school unhealthy, we have to gobble it up so we can't even digest that junk properly.
 
 The consumption of dry and greasy wedges is a time-consuming process, especially if you don't want to get cancer and you meticulously remove the burnt parts. Furthermore, you have to factor in the initial time needed to mentally prepare yourself for what you're about to go through.
 
 Even though I have my meals in monastic silence, I'm always the last one to finish. Many a time I arrive at class the following period while still chewing. On the other hand, my peers have elaborate conversations about whatever newfangled claptrap is currently popular and after five minutes their green plastic trays are already empty.
 
 I have several hypotheses to explain this phenomenon:
 
 * Exercising your jaws during speech increases chewing performance. As a result, the loud alpha male or female eats their food in the least amount of time.
 * The others use their cutlery to pulverise the food and then inhale it when they pause for breath between words.
 * They eat so messily that a large proportion of the food ends up somewhere like the ceiling fan.
 
 The only guy who brings lunch from home and therefore has a different-sized portion eats vinegar crisps sandwiched between two slices of white bread, a diet which I assume has been developed by a professional to meet his unique nutritional needs.
 
 Last but not least, there is an utter lack of hygiene. The older generations complain that we've killed the napkin industry, but they are the ones who don't provide us with any!

When am I allowed to give up?My sister (20) has been suicidal/depressed since she was about 13 years old and she has only gotten worse. It began when her closest friends in high school ditched her and turned everyone in her class against her. Since then she hasnâ€™t ever really recovered - did receive some help around then. She now refuses to seek any more help, says she will deal with it on her own and if it doesnâ€™t work and she decides to kill herself â€œsheâ€™s tried her bestâ€.

I come from a state in the tri-state area and moved to NY (manhattan specifically) for college (living in the dorms) Where I'm from there is no opportunity for someone like me because I am a creative, and if you werent a family friend of some rich Italian family who owned a pizza restaurant in my old town - then you were shit out of luck for any opportunity. Now I go to an art school because, believe me, I'm not capable of doing anything else. I am fucking stupid. And yes, it's expensive to be here. And yes, I got a significant amount of financial aid, and yes, it's still a lot of money. When I moved here, I didn't come with that much money. I've been very good at limiting what I spend, I only spend money on what I absolutely need. On top of college being a lot of money, everything here is also more costly. So money goes quick, even if it's only on essentials.

My class is full of wealthy exchange students who went out and bought everything on the list without any worry of financial stability during our break time. I spent 6 hours in that fucking studio class thinking about how I'm going to get all this shit and afford food at the same time. I walked to an art supply store nearby and almost considered stealing some things - but I didn't. I left empty handed and feeling like shit. 
 On top of school materials, I am practically wearing the same clothes every week because I have so few. I've resisted spending literally anything or going out anywhere if I can help it.

1290,"It gets worse beyond death.28 y/o divorced male here. With one beautiful son, and he's god sent. That being said, he is a real problem as I cannot handle the thoughts of how he will have to go through with life when I discharge a shotgun in my face. I've considered taking his life as well, in order to spare him.
 
 I am a completely and utterly hopeless romantic. I married my ex-wife after threatening to abort our child (we had an abortion a year before we had our son). The divorce and custody trials are still not over, have lasted over 3 years, and has put me in debt to my family trust for over $50,000. 
 
 I met an absolutely beautiful and exquisite individual over a dating app about two months ago. She fills me with joy and is the most remarkable woman I have ever met. She gave many different types of messages over the past few weeks, which have all been predominantly reassuring. This week my emotions boiled over a bit and I told her how much I want to be with her. Our phone call last night concluded with her telling me, in essence, that my emotional overflow has created a small rift between us and she is in need of the emotions to be removed from our equation. I haven't slept all week, as I've felt like I've been losing her, due to the fact that I have baggage, and am otherwise more invested in this than she is. I've looked all my life for someone like her. I detest the concept of not putting all my eggs in one basket, I've already hooked up with someone else since I met her to do precisely this, and I thought about her the entire time, it made me hate myself and want to purify, and thus, has caused me to overextend my affection and quite honestly appear to not have all my ducks in a line, in addition to how emotionally distraught I was in our most recent conversation. I have a 4-year degree and apply for better jobs on a daily basis, but to no avail, I am living in a high income area, and am no better off than I was a decade ago. I have a huge issue with capitalism, and, coming from both a conservative and military family, am routinely crucified verbally for my lack of personal motivation to seek and act in ways that will project my son and I forward. I have suffered from extreme depression since adolescence, took every antidepressant available in high school, and self medicated with marijuana for a decade. I can't cope with my situation, let alone another great romantic loss, any more than I can cope with the fact that I've never felt capable of overcoming the gravity of my emotions. As a single parent with full custody, options for seeking help are all but plentiful, especially with an ex-spouse eager to reverse the custody situation, who also happens to be in very dire straits financially. 
 
 Assuming I am compromised enough to even consider the destruction of my life, and even that of my sons to spare him pain, my only real issue is with God. As a frequent lucid dreamer and someone unable to recover from the daily perils of life through an inability to sleep without working through significant karmic events, (I routinely deal with the aftermath of sins such as murder, am imprisoned, or am otherwise finding myself in a deep state of isolated suffering when I dream), I am very much aware of the fact that there exists a life in the ether, and the truth is that my life in the ether is worse than it is in reality. I hate God for the situation that planet earth is currently in, and has been in for thousands of years, I hate that I cannot be at peace, having lived a life where I've tried to be considerate of others, and truly feel that there is no escape whether i commit suicide or not. I've felt this way for decades, and I've deteriorated to the point of complete anguish, where I truly wish to destroy my life and the lives of others as I see the human struggle to be so fickle and grotesque, my mind desires seeking the dark web to sign murder contracts, and then as I let my thinking spiral, I return to a state where I realize that I truly have no desire to hurt anyone, but to completely erase all aspects of myself entirely. No memories, no essence, no soul. Total obliteration and liberation through the end of what has felt like truly a life of magnified suffering. I don't know how to end this, because again, in my mind there is no end no matter what action I take, but I'm so sick and unorganized that it has effected each and every person involved in my life.",suicide
1291,"I just need someone to listen to me...Back story: I'm 18, I've been suffering from depression for 3 or 4 years but I don't want to go back to the doctor because I'm scared that they won't take me seriously and think I'm just another teenager. I have never talked about my problems to anyone else because when I try I freeze and am unable to say anything. Over the past couple of years, I have tried to kill myself over 20 times including pills and alcohol and trying to drown myself. 
 
 Now to my current problems:
 
 I came out at gay when I finished my GCSE's at 16. All my friends said they didn't care and all but within 2 months, I only had 2 or 3 friends that would still talk to me. When I went back to the school to pick up my GCSE certificates, about 100 people, all my old friends and classmates included, started shouting insults like faggot and queer, right up until I was 5 minutes down the road and couldn't hear them any more. My best friend at the time stopped talking to me about 2 or 3 months after this incident. My other friend at that time still talked to me and did right up until October 2011 when he stopped talking to me and started doing drugs and all sorts. 
 When I went to a new school after a year to start my A Levels, I made new friends, and they would come out with me and smoke weed and such, but then a month ago, they did the exact same thing as my other good friends did and just stopped talking to me, unless they need me for something, usually to ask me for a cigarette.
 At this same time, a month or so my last friends, had a baby. Now I understand that they had a baby and all but they just stopped talking to me as well. It's not even that they've not had time due to their child, but they have been going out nearly every day and had time to themselves, but nothing. Now, I have no friends that will talk to me and the only person I've talked to today is my mom and that was about 3 words.
 
 I'm in love with a straight guy in my school. I would talk to him and say how I feel, but I'm scared about what will happen due to my year group in school consisting of a whole 25 people who are all very good friends with each other, plus the way they get on with each other consists of finding something to make fun f someone for and taking the piss out of that for a long time. If I did say anything, my whole year group in school would hear about it within a day and I won't be able to stay there for another year because people will go on about it every day. I can't go to another school as this was the only one I was able to go to since I was previously doing a electrician training course somewhere else.
 
 I'm also poor as fuck. My mom has a lot of health problems and is unable to work. My dad works a job that earns just enough to cover the bills. I've been trying to find a job but somehow, the people with no qualifications at all get picked for jobs instead of me. All my clothes are borderline too small and are at least a year old.

 Anyway ill give you some background so you can help me with these problems, so around two years ago i was 16 got into my first real relationship with a girl named abbey about 9 months into the relationship she got really drunk at a party she got really angry at me when i told her to slow down a bit and tried to make out with one of my friends at the party needless to say it didn't work he didn't make out with her, for the remaining months of our relationship she acted extremely distant and unloving as i showered her with praise until around February last year I broke up with her. A bad and good break up at the same time as we were both extramly sad but were able to calmly talk to each other and come to an undersanding however my mother through this time told me she was disappointed in me because I wouldn't get over her in literally two days and said she must of raised me wrong because i'm fucked up anyway.....
 
 Between that time and now I got a job at McDonalds hated it quit got kicked out of my house got forced to move back into my house normal school issues however i don't mind school that much rampant suicidal thoughts and just generally scared of the future and sad at life. Throughout this time abbey would message me now and again and wed talk for a couple of days before i stopped as i never really stopped having feelings towards her so i couldn't talk to her without feeling like shit.
 
 ok so here's the real problem we started talking two months ago ended up started having casual sex weekly i know great idea, said at the begging that if we chose to date people we would be ok with that and would stop this. one of my friends asked her out couple of days ago im not ok with that they went out on a date none of them told me she lied to me about why she couldn't come round and where she went. I worked it out for myself [here are the texts from tmrw to today when i worked it out](http://imgur.com/a/927HO).
 
  I just read through that and have left a bit out but i hope this gives the general gist of what im trying to say honestly i never fell out of love with her i don't think that's really something i can do but i know she has with me.

 I'm 31 and have lived an incredibly dismal life. As a child I lived with a single mom, she had me when she was eighteen. She had no aspirations and not much of an education. So we lived with her parents off and on until she was over thirty. Which was alright except that my grandfather never took it up to be the male role model in my life. He was extremely cynical of me, and would make me cry pretty well daily. And for some reason I'd cry until I vomited, which I believe contributed to my future stomach problems. It sucks pretty bad when you're eight years old and your own family won't believe you have heatburn. It's like leaving me there to bleed out. I was very thankful of this when I vomited blood up for the first time due to the burning in my stomach.
 
 By the time I was in grade two I was removed from my school due to behavioral issues and placed in a ""special"" class for misbehaved students. This was also in a catholic school. It was an extremely hostile environment, and putting problem kids in a class full of problem kids is probably the worst idea I've ever heard. But it's still happening to this day and damaging the lives of countless children. The lax learn at your own pace philosophy they seem to have held probably wasn't very beneficial to a lot of the students. The only thing that pushed you to the next grade was to simply be there. There were no tests to pass, no work to be graded on. You didn't even have to do anything. 
 
 In grade five we moved from the big city to a super small town, they didn't have behavioral classes, but I made so many friends and things were happy, the days were bright. Six months later we moved to another small town because my mom met some guy. We moved in with him. I made more friends, everything was OK I went to school there were no problems (They didn't have behavioral programs for students in these places in the country it seems, we moved from toronto to new brunswick to nova scotia)",suicide

I know it sounds all so stupid but everyone of my friends all care and love each other so much but when it comes to me im just nothing I dont want to leave bed or my room i just want to eat junk food until i cant move and just rot away. Im so digusting and unattractive, no one will ever love me, ill be alone forever, no one will ever care, so why dont i just fucking end it get it over with what the point on sticking around, there is none. I want to end my life so bad, i feel like looking up suicide methods is so so comforting because its like i know there is a way to escape. I know i am stupid and people hate me because i have no reason to feel this way but it only makes me want to end it more. There is no help I can get, ive done it all. Why bother i just dont want to take up space and peoples time anymore i hate being a burden I just dont want this anymore. i want my friends to be happy and have a good life and they dont deserve someone who is disgusting and a nuisance in their life.",suicide

 I posted here a couple of days ago, x-posted in another sub with very little response. 
 I am a female in my midthirties who is severely chronically ill, physically disabled, and unable to drive or work. My condition is such that it is physically impossible for me to live alone. I have been through two awful divorces and am currently trapped in an often abusive engagement to a guy whom I have strong reasons to believe has been unfaithful to me. He is a narcissist. 
 
 Despite negative full panel STD test results, I have continued for six months and counting to experience terrible unexplainable symptoms that appear to only align with an STD. I don't want to be right about my suspicions. My entire life rests upon whether or not my partner did something he shouldn't have done. I literally have no friends nor family to turn to for help if he has betrayed me; absolutely no one. I do not use Facebook. He and I have lived with his mother for a couple of years now and I just made the huge mistake of confiding in both his mother and my partner's sister about my fears. They are beginning to tip my partner off about my suspicions of him.
 
  Anyone who has been abused and is trapped knows what that can mean. I am freaking terrified now. I have nowhere to go if he finds out that I don't trust him. I convinced him to take me to get retested early next month, but my whole future rides on those results. I have no one to stay with. My mother passed away from a terrible illness one month ago and my father and I do not get along at all. Staying with him is simply out the question. I am entirely alone. Going to a shelter is impossible for me because a physically disabled person is considered a liability and I have experience with being turned away from them already in the past. I have absolutely no recourse in this situation now. I am absolutely terrified and completely freaking alone. Oh God. The only way out of this is death. Can someone please talk to me and help me through this before I make a very bad decision??",suicide

 I have thoughts. I don't know why I have these thoughts, I think about why I have these thoughts. I think about whether or not the fact that I'm thinking about whatever I'm thinking about means anything, and if it does, what? I don't trust the way my thoughts form. I don't know who I am. I don't know what I am.
 
 I WANT TO DIE. DYING IS ALL I HAVE EVER WANTED TO DO SINCE I WAS 6. I have been depressed, suicidal since I was 6.
 
 I'm crazy. I'm insane. Let me tell you about my day today. This is **ONE** example of a day of mine.
 
 I drove 1000 miles with no break. Why? Because I was bored. For the first 5 hours, I had these thoughts. Thoughts of murder. I felt strange. I just wanted to murder and torture innocent people. I made specific plans to kidnap, rape, torture, and kill some women. I DON'T WANT TO HURT ANYBODY. I have urges. Every moment of every day, my behavior is different from my thoughts and my intentions. It's as if two entities are possessing me; one controls my mind, the other controls my body.
 
 My parents abused me. A lot. Every day. And the worst part? They genuinely care about me, and that guilted the FUCK out of my child self. Everything about their behavior said ""I hate you. You're worthless. We wish you were dead. Kill yourself."" and they abused my mind EVERY. SINGLE. DAY. But they love me. Their behavior is 100% inconsistent with their thoughts. They're INSANE PEOPLE. They are absolutely batshit insane people, beyond comprehension. They are more insane than I am, and I can feel myself turning into my father more and more every day and the thought that I am becoming like him absolutely crushes me.
 
 I'm worried my urges will get worse. I'm worried I will do something unforgivable before I realize it. I want to die. I want the sweet release of death. Being in this mind is torture. 
 
 I regret every single thing I have done in life. I can't believe I got to this point.
 
 I have no friends, no family, no dreams, no motivations, no likes, no dislikes, no opinions of my own. I am a mindless drone, isolated and spending every second of every day alone with my own thoughts.
 
 Please, talk to me. I tell myself I don't want help, but I do. I want help. I want to be happy. I want to have dreams. I want to make other people smile and laugh with them. I want to have meaningful connections with other people. But I just can't. All I do is send myself farther and farther down the hole.
 
 I wasn't always like this. I had dreams as a very young kid. I was nice to everyone, and just wanted everyone to get along and be happy. I just wanted to be happy, to help others. But my parents FUCKED. ME. UP. THEY DID THIS TO ME. LIVING WITH THEM WAS **ABSOLUTE HELL**.
 
 I'm crying. I'm a 19 year old dude. I look 12, and I feel like a 70 year old man with the mind of a tormented 6 year old. Please talk to me. Ask me questions. I want to fix myself. I want to be happy. I am going to get mental help in about two weeks, but for now, I just need something, ANYTHING. So I turn to you guys. Please, I beg of you. I just want to hear from other people. I want to die more than anything else, but a small piece of me doesn't.

I spent most of this weekend in my bed. I wanted to go out and do things but one way or another I seemed to convince myself not to. I have a good support network which I'm extremely grateful. The feeling that I have let my family and loved ones down has been fundamental in the way that I have viewed every day since I was 12 or 13. I'm now 27 (M). Significant mental health issues and substance abuse have been ongoing problems for me since then. In this time, I have continued to meet a few amazing people who have challenged my cynicism about humanity. This adds to my conflict; Do I want to be here? Is me being here of enough benefit to be worth it? 
 
 
 My dreams and goals are barely worth mentioning anymore because my work towards achieving them has completely stagnated. I am no longer sure if I am capable of ever completing my university degree and making the world a slightly better place through my career. During the pandemic and recession, the government in my country has been providing financial assistance to people who lost their jobs due to the economic circumstances, I am one of these people. I am very grateful for what has been provided to me, but the government money provided to us is about to be reduced and sustaining myself is about to become more difficult unless I can manage to find a new job.

I know that I'm the common link here, I know that I get along well with mentally ill people because I'm mentally ill, but how the fuck do I fix all this? I couldn't deal with another loved one dying from drug/alcohol overdose or suicide. I can't count them on both hands anymore. I know there are people in much worse positions but I can't talk to anyone about this stuff and I feel so alone. Today was a nice day, why am I still like this. It's almost 4am now.

 So basicly I know that one of my friends was going to go into the military but he was planning on doing 4 years of ROTC before he went in so we were going to all spend college together, yay right? Well no.
 
 Because apparently to get where they wanted in the military (Special ops and army medic respectively) they would have a better chance if they just enlisted out of highschool AND the minimum enlistment is 5 years... they where thinking about doing 8.....

 I have been depressed since I was 13 but when I turned 15 I got suicidal. I feel lonely and I think about how I should kill myself when I'm at school or when I'm eating etc. 
 I almost never sleep for more than 2-4 hours per night which makes me very tired at school and I only sleep in class. 
 
 I don't really have a good reason for being suicidal except that I hate the way everyone lives, wake up, go to work, get paid, go home, eat, sleep and then it starts all over again. I also feel like i'm such a dick towards everyone, as I don't care about anything anymore, some people are annoyed by my negativity towards everything. 
 
 Being alive is just pain and suffering. I've almost stopped feeling emotions at all, I don't feel empathy towards people anymore, only for animals. Now at school i've just started pretending that everything is alright after someone said that I was emo or something like that and now it's just too hard to ""be happy"".",suicide

Show me how you hold onto reality in times of unbelievable events.I feel as though there is, at this point, no way for me to come to a conclusion about the validity of some of my thoughts and perceptions. Sometimes, I have a hard time hearing people and I'll just hear gibberish with certain words mixed in that give it various malicious intents. This normally only happens when I have been awake for more than 24 hours. Also, while in this state, I watch myself come off as ignorant or excessively socially awkward while my inner thoughts are quite perceptive of the body language and general mood of the situation. Usually, other people are completely confused, unhelpful, or downright mean and mocking. It feels as if some people never left elementary school.
 
 I have been very confident in the past so I know what it is like to be accepted and to perform in a way that elicits a positive reaction from friends and strangers. This makes the fluctuation between ability to focus/listen for understanding and distraction/anxiety even more frustrating and unpredictable.
 
 Some backstory: Never was socially adept until high school and still had limited success but that was mostly due to my lack of interest in the most popular of culture. I had a small group of friends who also took a long time to warm up to me. I have trusted people less and less as I get older and more experienced with the fact that everyone has lied, can lie, do lie, to cover up something they consider extremely embarrassing or to preserve something they fear losing. The former reason to lie is slightly less annoying than the latter and I automatically assume the person is capable of both great good AND malevolence, a balance everyone sits somewhere on. It is the latter desire to hoard 'precious' objects or people through EXTENSIVE deceit and [Gaslighting]() that has planted the seed of, first, my belief that the exact opposite of what is readily obvious could actually be the REAL truth and, second, the expansion of this to the realization that the webs of proof and science (and CLEARLY religion) are not as perfectly indisputable as most people trust they are. Once this truth is realized it opens the flood gates for endless permutations of possibility, especially using the current theories being worked on trying to define the relationship between thought and matter. I'm sorry if reading this puts you into a similar state but I'm starting to get more and more scared and I really need to know your HONEST opinions about the explanation of so many coincidences that it defies the definition of 'coincidence'. For example, I was driving a car with a girl in the passenger seat and we pull up to a light where a bum holds a sign that reads ""I need a Job and clothes"". I (clearly incredibly insensitively) joke to the girl by saying, ""Hey, yea buddy I need those too..."" Immediately after saying this a car pulls up beside us with a sticker that says exactly: ""You don't need it"". We have a hearty and yet vaguely tense laugh about the 'synchronicity'.
 
 These things are happening more and more often and I could list at least 5 more that are unbelievable enough to honestly build a case for an intelligent force affecting reality in some way. I was not raised religious in any way and, in fact, was a staunch skeptic for most of my life as it pertains to mysticism.
 
 I am very serious, I NEED to know exactly what you believe and **WHY**. The why, preferably, would consist of personal experiences with no alternate explanation OR that initially seemed to have no reason but was later shown to be natural. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE help me, and undoubtedly more redditors, to find some way to stop constantly taking this factor into account as it pertains to such mundane daily events such as a sign held by a bum causing a damn existential crisis.

 I have to hand in my graduation thesis by this Friday, but I have not been able to type more than 800 words these last months. I am stuck at my parents' house because of the outbreak and they have already told me that if I don't graduate they will not pay for me to return to college next year just to complete my thesis because they do not believe I will be able to. The thought of having to drop out when I only have this one thing left makes me cry every time, as I've always had a lot of pressure regarding academics. Even if I typed constantly for 48 hours I will probably fail anyway, as I have not kept in touch with my tutor due to my social phobia making it almost impossible for me to reach out, even less when it's by email (and this communication is a very big part of our grade).
 
 This may sound like a stupid reason for ending it all, but honestly when all your life revolves around academics and you know that you will 100% lose all the opportunities that were waiting for you after graduation the future just seems like a dark void of nothingness. 
 
 I think that all this time I had just been looking for a good reason to actually kill myself, and right now all I can think about is how big of a failure as a person I am. Even my therapist has been pressuring me to finish my thesis and graduate and then focus on my problems during summer, but I just cannot deal with all this pressure and all the negative thoughts that have been stopping me from being productive this last year.

 Lately, I just lie in bed and stare at the ceiling every night, until a thought comes across that hits a sensitive spot. Then, I have an emotional breakdown and lose control for a moment. I get the urge to physically punish myself. Sometimes, I take a sharp knife and blindly cut around on my leg. Sometimes, I grab a bottle of trichloroethylene and inhale that until I pass out, although it has nearly killed me once in the past. After a while, the emotions pass on, and I go back to feeling empty and doing nothing, until the cycle repeats. I've lost interest in all the things I liked to do. Nothing brings me joy anymore. The only times I still feel good is after a ridiculous amount of caffeine or a joint, but the feeling passes quickly, and then I go back to feeling like shit.

1474,"Hey, Lar...[home](http://i.imgur.com/8nD5j.jpg)
 
 Your arms were the only ones in which I was truly loved and safe. Yeah, I get it: your own parent not wanting you. After you died, Mom made it really clear I was a nuisance. 
 
 She left me with pedophiles, more than one, with me literally begging and screaming for her not to walk out that door while they sat there awaiting the pleasure they'd take with me the second she left. Even if she was in the next room, or taking a quick shower, I was the fuckdolly.
 
 Did you know that one of them was at me for years? Yeah, he'd kill my pets to keep me quiet. Another one of her boyfriends. Had my childhood dog, EB, for years...he drowned her in the bathtub. He killed several. Told me Mom would hate me if she ever found out that I had turned him on so much that he had to fuck me until he was ""completely satisfied"". Yeah, she managed to throw this in my face when she found out - jealousy over maternal instinct. She's a fucking abusive cunt. This was along with all the violent beatings he laid on mom and me, not to mention that he kept us indoors and isolated for years...aside from the times he was in and out of prison.
 
 Know how all this came out? He knocked me up at the ripe old age of 13. I had to have an abortion. He was going to be charged with several things, not just for the sexual part, but unlawful confinement, too. 
 Did you know that Mom always treated me like a nuisance, even before the pedos...telling me that she wished I'd never been born, screaming, ""Are you fucking retarded?!"" if I did something kids normally do, such as accidently tipping my juice over at breakfast or took too long doing dishes. Enter her violent blowups, slaps, punches, being dragged around by my hair while she screamed visciously. Bitch loved to slam her fist between my shoulder blades when I didn't even see it coming. I lived in constant fear in childhood. I acted out...not knowing how to relate to others, alienating my peers at school. No friends...the girl everyone scorned. There was no comfort when I was told ""No one likes you!"" with such vehemence that it still burns in my memory to this day. You have no idea how this has isolated me...fuck people. Not going anywhere near them. Isolation is my greatest defence. When you have it drilled in your head that you're unwanted, it sticks so deeply. It burns into the deepest trenches of your being.
 Mom dragged to that fucking tiny hellhole she's from. Think that went well? You know the one...where they're tighter than thieves. I was so beaten down and shy, of course they took it as me thinking I was better than them. I couldn't even look anyone in the eye, I was so shy. The curled their upper lip when I'd pass by. I did nothing to deserve this. I never hurt any of them, I'd only wanted to be accepted. It didn't help that her next ""husband"" tried to convince me I'm crazy because I only knew to isolate and couldn't talk to anyone. I love my mom, no matter what she did, and I'd call him on his obnoxious behaviour towards her and it made us enemies. I hated him deeply as he was a bully, and knew she'd do anything in her codepent, clingy way to keep him. He'd told me ways of disposing of bodies and not get caught...told me he would have killed my mother once if I hadn't walked in the room. He'd sliced up the mother of his son to the point that he'd had served time in a criminal psch ward, and arrogantly defended his actions, going on about how she deserved it and how much he hated her. Whenever he didn't like someone, his first comment was that ""there was something wrong with them in the head"". Holy fuck...pot calling the kettle black or what, eh?There's can't really be anything truly wrong with me...I was just kicked around too much, wasn't I? Please tell me I'm not crazy...it's eaten away at me for years. I know rationally I'm not crazy, but this fucking neurotic bullshit eats at me. I was truly happy when he died...he was evil. I'd rather have O'brien and the other pedophiles than him. Fuck, everyone thought he was so ""nice""...good old ""uncle rick"". Piece of motherfucking shit...even his corpse is a waste of space.
 Did you know that mom got a lot of money from criminal injuries when you died? She was supposed to save it for me, but spent it on herself, a house and her boyfriends. I was lucky to fucking eat, or get rags from fucking thrift stores for clothes. She still gets cheques each month while your grandkids sit in poverty. I took out student loans trying to make something of my self and the debt of it is fucking crushing. I nearly finished my degree, but trying to make it on my own with the kids too soon after birth nearly killed me. Postpartum depression and the stress of it all, I've tried to be strong. The kids dad left even before your grandaughter was born. I gave birth to her, going to university full time and still made the first year winning a scholarship. I struggled against depression best I could, but I dropped out three times over the years, each time summoning stubborn strength to meet the goal of graduating. Three strikes, I was out. No more access to means to finish. No jobs to cover tuition, loans wiped their hands of me, understandably. My own stubborn will to try and complete blew up in my face. Left with lots of theory and all the pretentious academic terms to describe them, but not one practical skill from it all. Nonetheless, you grandkids - You'd be so fucking proud of those two...hearts of gold and that sparking humour and brains we got from you, certainly not her. I know you'd have spoiled us...Mom told us that you really, really loved me more than anything you'd ever in your life. I know that if you were as ga ga over me as you were, you'd be twice as much over them. Nonetheless, we struggle...I've been so isolated for most of my life. O'brien, Mom, that hellhole she dragged me to, settling for the prick of a biological father and more isolation trying to raise the babies in a two bedroom apartment for years, not a soul to turn to. Not a way to reach out as the isloation eroded any sort of chance to build the means to reach out, connect and bond with anyone. We're stuck in poverty...there's no fucking jobs in this fucking dead end town, and even if there were, I freeze, paralyzed when I try to interact. They won...I get it: I'm stupid, I'm crazy, and I'm unwelcome. I am not allowed to be, life if for ""other people"". 
 
 From what Mom tells me, you would have have stood before stampedes to protect me...I was the apple of your eye, you loved me because I was the only thing you ever loved or were loved by. Fuck, all this shit is just the tip of the iceberg. I spoke to your little sister, without telling her my intentions, and she'd be happy to take the kids in case anything happened to me. They're better off without me, I'm so fucking stressed out and scared all the time...snarling and isolating from them and everyone else in the world. They'd be better off with her. They're the only things I love in this world, but I'm no good for them. Daddy, please...I'm so fucking scared...I'm so fucking shoved away. I tried, I really truly did. I've tried to get education and make things better...I've tried to be the best person I can, but nothing helps. Please...take me back to you. Just hold me in your arms, make it all go away. I've given it my best shot, but over three decades of this shit truly has me worn down. I can't go on like this. I need to be back in your arms where we loved each other and we were home. At the time I could afford it, I had a gravestone made for you as I'd spent years looking for your grave and no one told me that you were so uncared for that no one had bothered. Your own father...my mother. Both had the means to do so, but hey, it was all about them, you know? I just had your name tattoed on me to honour you, proudly carrying you with me forever, so you know that yes, someone loved you sincerely. I can't do this anymore, however. I've struggled and tried to do my best. I just want to be back with you. No one wants me here, I'm not allowed to live and shouldn't be. I'm not welcome, I'm unwanted...got it. Loud and clear. PLEASE Just take me back home to you, Daddy,I've tried so hard - just take me back - I don't want to be here. PLEASE, I fucking beg you...",suicide

1485,"I hate my health...I'm 20 years old, male, and I've got problems. I grew up in an abusive family, and I'm still living here. I'm about to postpone college so I can move out, but those are little things.
 
 My health has been failing for the past several years. I've developed a shit ton of food allergies... I can barely eat anything, and with what little I can, it's impossible to get all the vitamins needed for my body to function correctly... and that leads to even more problems, and it's alot more than you might think at first... The list of things I can eat is literally shorter than the list of things I can't. Even trace amounts of food that I can't have will trigger a response. If someone drinks out of something, then kisses me, I'm screwed for about 2 months. At first, I'll be in pain. The other symptoms are almost like having the flu, and then I'll be extremely tired. Sometimes I'll pass out one day, and wake up two days later. I'll be very tired like this for about a week to a month. The pain will last a day, sometimes more, but it's the more visible effects that get to me the most. The skin on my face will explode into pimples and my entire face will be covered with a red rash. This is the part that lasts for about 2 months... I've been to 4 different allergy doctors, a dietitian, and a dermatologist, and none of them could help me. The longer I avoid the foods, the worse the responses seem to be... and they're almost inevitable. If a dish isn't washed well enough, I'll react to it. If a knife was placed on a counter, I'll react to whatever it's used to cut. Lots of fruits are covered in a corn based wax, which I react to, and even companies that I'm used to buying canned tomatoes or anything as basic as that will switch their ingredients before they switch the label, then there goes 2 months of my life. If I react to something 1 out of every 100 days, then 60% of the time, I'll have to deal with these symptoms. On top of that, I'm also diabetic.
 
 It doesn't end there either. If I get sick, it usually lasts about 5x-10x longer for me than for other people because my immune system is focused on tracking down pollen and food particles; so it doesn't invest anywhere near as much resources to fight bacteria and disease as a normal person's would. I'd give more information, but I'm already pretty identifiable as it is.
 
 Lately, I've been really losing touch with reality... my problems are so unrealistic, I question them myself sometimes, but they've consistently proven themselves to be real.... I've held a gun to my head 3 times since december, but I've been too pussy to pull the trigger... I heard of a cure that might work, but it's illegal in the U.S. and costs over $3k, and my parents refused to fund it, even though they buy and rent out houses for a living... she rubbed it in my face too.... I'm really not sure my sanity will last long enough to get there myself.

1491,Hi i'm new to here.Idk how to use.nice to meet you all.,suicide
1493,"I feel like my suicide would be perfectly fitting/ poetic justice
 Is that the right term?? This is what I mean:
 
 As far as I know, my schoolâ€™s never had a suicide. If anyone should kill themselves (not that anyone should), it should be me. It would have the biggest effect if it was me. It would seem reasonable and people would be shocked but wouldnâ€™t be SURPRISED. 
 I was very severely bullied every day for 4 years by 13 people, and about 6 at once. The teachers had never seen bullying so extreme. The ENTIRE YEAR hated me and almost everyone knew it. I was the most hated person in the year, maybe even the school, for NO REASON. Or at least nothing in my control. Bullying is one of the most horrible things of humanity. 
 I have been depressed for about the last 2 years. And I have very very few friends and no social life at all. Having no friends damages your self esteem in every way possible. I never did ANYTHING intentionally wrong to the people who bullied me. I just burst into tears writing this. I didnâ€™t deserve a single SECOND of the hell they gave me EVERY DAY for 4 years ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­
 
 If I killed myself, all those kids would think â€œShe really did itâ€ and would say â€œWE drove her to thisâ€ and kids at neighbouring schools would say â€œYou know (my name) who got picked on? She committed suicideâ€ and â€œA girl from (my school) killed herself!â€ And â€œEveryone made fun of one girl for no reason and always made a joke out of her and were so mean to her and there were always so many bystanders but NO ONE EVER STUCK UP FOR HER because they all just wanted to follow the crowd, thinking â€œOh itâ€™s (my name) so itâ€™s okay to treat her like SHIT and look down on her and TELL HER to KILL HERSELF and then just go on with their day like itâ€™s nothingâ€ and now sheâ€™s dead.â€
 
 Then my death could at least raise awareness and maybe (definitely) reduce bullying at my school and the pastoral support would double. Maybe that was my purpose after all. Also no one would care if I wasnâ€™t there.
 I would walk into our house common room and the same boy would announce my entrance to the whole crowd and while everyone silenced would shout â€œGET OUT LARA. NO ONE WANTS YOU HERE.â€ in such a sincere way. They made it pretty clear I was unwanted there. 
 
 No one really cares about me. Or maybe they all care, just not enough. 
 
 The only way people would care about me is if I was dead. Similarly, Iâ€™ve been thinking.. what if the only way to not feel bad is to stop feeling anything at all, forever?
 
 I donâ€™t want to stall too much so that Iâ€™ve left school when I do it because then the school wonâ€™t take responsibility and will be able to say it wasnâ€™t because of them. I donâ€™t want the wrong people to be blamed. 
 
 I donâ€™t know how much longer I can go on. Itâ€™s like a candle is burning, and I donâ€™t know how much is left of it (height) but I can tell from the puddle of wax on top it isnâ€™t much. 
 
 It wouldnâ€™t be a loss if I died and I would actually be doing people a favour.",suicide
1494,"I want to kill bullies, not even my bullies, any bully.I want to kill everyone who harassed me throughout life. Realistically, I can't kill them all at once without getting caught in the process. I could settle on killing 20 bullies and then myself.
 
 Also, when I attended elementary school, sometimes they'd place me in an in school detention room and each kid was always black except for me (white), I was usually sent there by the teacher who on several occasions purposely bent over to ""help me"" with my school work and her shirt would be loose and expose her breasts.

1512,"For everyone who came here looking for help.This is something I stumbled upon writing one of those days, yes we all know, one of THOSE days. Its a hard outlook on life, but hell once I wrote it down I can tell you I felt a lot better. I post this in hopes to help you. It's very lenghty and probably many grammatical errors, but I the tears were in my eyes and the voices in my head were distracting me, so I did my best. And Best of luck to you all. I believe if you can read this and face it as the truth, you can make it through this, just as I did. Because you start seeing things as no overall point. If I were to try to put it in words you could understand it would be you start taking ""risks"" and with risks comes ""reward"". You won't even notice it at first. But it will be there.
 
 I would have to say, to one guy, just one guy, there is no point. No point. None. I simply don't see how you can disagree, you cannot give me a valid reason to why there is with actual evidence or supporting details, you can't. I dare you to try, I dare you to tempt fate. It's simply put at that, there is no point. It's all just there, you can't put it together, you can't write it out, because if you were to try, there would be no point. Do you get where I'm headed? Of course you don't. Because I'm headed no where, because there is no point. It has been shown over and over again in every way possible, people are just to blind to see, that they put words to it to try and make sense. But yet, there is none. No sense. There is nothing this world wouldn't give, to fill it with sense. To give it a point. There is no knowledge, there is none. How can you possibly say you know, when you yourself haven't known before. Can you just simply believe it, because they tell you so? There is no knowing, there is no point. I'll try and put it into terms that we have all agreed upon, and believe it to be real. It's trial and error, guess and check, nothing else. There is no point. So how can we all decide, what to put behind this? When you yourselves, don't know.Is there such a thing as success, or has it been around so long that what used to be just faith and hope, turned into our reality. How do you know?..... How do you know? Take it to yourself to think. Has the hope and thought of success become something, the one thing, that we all humans agree upon? Letters and numbers. It's all just how we put together the everything, the everything of nothing. There is no point. We simply must agree that there is no such idea. How many times must it be shown to us, that there is no point. There is a such thing as nothing, and it is everything that we see. Just what we have agreed upon makes it something. Why can't we allow the thought of being ""unhappy""? What makes it unhappy, and to whom? Does that really justify what can make one happy or not? Have we just been so worn out with the fight of being ""unhappy"" that we seek happiness? But can it really be sought? How can you deny something to not be right, when it never leaves you? It never leaves you, it will always appear, and come upon us. So can we embrace it, can't we all just let it happen? Why do we continue to escape it, when all it does is return, harsher, as if it were angry at us? We have left it for too long. I have left it for too long. I will not change, I will not cheer, I will not forget that it is here. It's inside us. The only thing you have to do is look deep enough. When faced with the chance to escape it, I will, just as we all would, but I will not forget. I will allow it to come back upon me. I will surrender to it. Maybe, just maybe, it won't forgive me. 
 
 Even now I am still holding to grips with myself and how I will always be ""unhappy"" I probably wont call it this for very much longer, because its not really being ""unhappy"" its more of human nature. We have grown out of ourselves, we have become distant with our nature, our true meaning and being, the true meaning and being that there is no true meaning to it. We are just here, and we cant accept it now. Its been too long, why oh why cant the people just see? We aren't here for a reason, we just are, it happened, so what. Live with it, there is no need to find this out, so there is no need to find anything else. Do what you are good at and that should be suffice to what makes you ""happy"". It's more of a fit in your place that you were put sort of thing. We are toys to a creation that is and forever will be beyond our understanding. We will never know, so we can just stop trying and ignore the subject. I will go as far to say as I am no longer an Atheist. However I will not bring my understanding of something of which I can not understand into my own reality that I have thus created so far. This is something that I am going to leave alone and go on with my day, because does it really matter? Does it? Back to being a toy. We are all one, we have no right to do otherwise, we need to find what we can do, and do it. No questions. Don't think about what you do. Just do it. If you are needed elsewhere something will call for it. But what you are doing is what you must. Because that is what we have given the title, ""happiness"". What we are made to do, individually. But its simply beyond that, the concept is made up. Its just to keep us in our places, but we have made it be for so long, well that happiness has become something, and with anything that is something, there is always the opposite. We made an opposite to nothing, something that isnt there. So how can we break from this cycle? Well just remember. No feelings. Do what you are meant to do. We can think with our own brains to figure out what that is. And follow it, but once feelings get involved, you need to drop it. and think again. It's something that must be done. In order to break the cycle. Of which we have named, ""Depression and happiness"".",suicide

I've contemplating the idea of killing myself before whenever i was depressed on my pre-teen years, anyway i never did it 'cause deep inside me i knew it was my depression doing the thinking, not my brain. Now, years later, is the first time im actually thinking about it without being depressed. I've, for the first time, analyzed everything with a critical mind. Life just makes no fucking sense. The way the world works, is the most stupid system that anyone could come up with, im here now all down and fucking desperate because i can't get a job. Im all suffocated by the senseless concept that money is. I've been trying to get a job since i finished school 3 years ago but here none hires you if you have no experience, you are ugly or they just don't fucking know you. People here only hire friends of friends. I can't push myself here 'cause. Here's the thing. I can't talk. This has been my biggest problem my whole miserable life since i remember. I don't know how to talk to people . I can't express myself, i can't even go to the grocery store alone to buy shit. i've had social anxiety in the past, i've been homeschooled the last 2 years of high school. All my problems are originated by my lacking social skills. I've always blamed this on my family for rising me like shit making me grow up to be the selfish incapable of talking piece of shit that i'm now. I always hated everyone for not liking me. I only have one friend, and she and my two siblings are the only people i talk to. I mean don't even ""talk"" to them, i just answer whatever shit they tell me. BUT FINALLY i realized that i have none but myself to blame for this shitty life im living. I fucking hate myself. I can't believe I lived so long without realising it.I fucking hate myself for isolate me and push everyone away from me. I could have had so many friends but i pushed them away, i never did anything nice for anyone. I can't fucking think on one stupid small good thing i ever did for anyone. I never hugged anyone honestly. I've never been to a party. I've never told anyone that i liked them, I was never told neither. I've never kissed anyone. There are so many things i never did 'cause i decided that the rest of the world wasn't worth it. And now i see this things i always blamed on my upbringing and oh jesus im the only one to blame, im so miserable. i hate myself so much for it. The worst part is that now i want to change that but i can't cause i was never given the tools to do so. I was always alone. I don't know how to reach out for anyone. I honestly don't know what im supposed to do. My sister was the only pilar in my life but yesterday she decided to stop helping me 'cause i never did anything with the help she gave me. She is fucking right, i hate seeing her waste her life trying to help a lost cause like me. I live with my brother and he tries to talk to me but all i do is scream at him and tell him to leave me alone. I have problems, i'd went to the therapist before, i've had like four different doctors over the past years, but they never helped me 'cause i never told them anything, they only asked me stuff and i answered them or i even let my mother answer the questions for me. Now i have no money to go to a shrink. I have no job, my brother doens't have a job and i just can't do anything to get one. I have no parents nor family besides my siblings. My sister who was the only support i had, decided to stop helping me and now Im here all alone in the dark in my room wondering how a piece of living shit like myself could get to the end of the month. Im fucking desperate. I have no tools to face what is comming. I don't even want to die. There are so many things i want to do but i cant because of how i am. I don't want to die, i just don't want to be myself anymore I fucking hate the person i've become. i can't ""un-become"" me. i don't know how, i don't even think that that's possible. i hate living in my skin.
 
 I just wanted someone to know this. How i am feeling. To hear my feelings before i fade. I won't send or tell this to any of the 3 people i have left. I know they can't help me. The only person that can help me right now is me. but im not able to. i gave myself an ultimatum of 10 days left to figure it out. if i don't find a solution on this lapse i'm going to kill myself.
 
 p.s. : ironically i've always wanted to be a screenwriter but I desisted the idea because my writing sucks.. so i'm sorry for whoever tried to understand what i just wrote here.

 But now in my current situation, I feel an existential sadness.
 
 Iâ€™m leaving the house I was born and raised in. I can look anywhere in my house and see a memory. A past me. 
 
 Iâ€™m leaving behind my best friend, a dude who I have known since... forever. I literally canâ€™t remember a time where I havenâ€™t known him.
 
 Iâ€™m leaving behind an array of elementary school friends whoâ€™ve been so kind to me over the years.

1528,"Sick of constantly wanting to dieI mean, like most people on this forum, I want to die. Constantly. Even when I am happy I want to die. I am just sick of always feeling tired and not feeling like my life is mine. I work three jobs and am taking part in graduate school. I have a best friend, whom I love very very much, but constantly feel like I have to emotionally babysit. I have a boyfriend whom I love but honestly can't feel comfortable with; my fear of him abandoning me makes it hard for me to relax and enjoy our relationship. I have lost two best friends whom I can't seem to get over or forget. My father, the only supportive parent in my life, has cancer. My mother is a complete c*nt and manages to make me feel guilty for existing despite me knowing full well our damaged relationship isn't my fault. I fear all of my friends really hate me and are putting up with me. I feel like school just isn't worth it. I'm so busy I don't have time to go see a doctor, or therapist, or go to the gym (exercise makes people feel better sometimes). Despite having 3 jobs I have money problems. Almost zero me time. 
 
 I want to die. But I'm scared of dying painfully. I want to die peacefully. I hate waking up. I don't want to feel this way.",suicide
1531,Im a fucking failureMy depression just hit me like a truck about a hour ago. I started a new job today my first job actually. I was working for long hours outside serving food and icecream and other desserts and when I get home I find out I took counterfeit money and need to learn how to detect better. Im just devasted because I need to make something work and earn money. I was scammed for over 2000 dollars a few weeks ago so I have been getting really fucked by life. Its over,suicide
1532,"All my life I've been lonelyNo real friends. Never had sex or had a girlfriend, never kissed, never smoked or drink. I'll end up being 50 years old not accomplishing shit and will look back when I was 19 and wished I did what other normal people could do. Party on fridays, sit on the beach after midnight kissing girls. I can only dream. Fucking fucked off about how other people are luckier then I am. Cunts. Fuck them all. I've had it, I have no groups, no friends to turn to, cause they're all fake assholes. Never ever ever ever ever chat to me on facebook, nothing, no likes, no friends no nothing. Must as well end it now.",suicide
1533,"Just exhausted of continually feeling this way, and it's not bound to get any better.The past 6 months has been an incredibly tumultuous time for me. In the time that's passed, I've experienced the following: 
 * Experienced the end of my first adult love, leaving me and my self esteem in shambles to the point where I believe that no one would be insane enough to love someone like me, and even if they did they'd just find flaws to nitpick at and leave me for anyway
 * Lost the majority of my friends after this, and the ones that remained are too far away and are too busy living their own lives to a point where I've been reluctant to reach out to them.
 * Almost didn't graduate from college but barely got by, and found myself neck-deep in student loan debt.
 * Moved back home where my entire family experience is my father being overseas for a job in order to make ends meet, while my mother is constantly yelling at me for one reason or another. This has gotten to the point where I don't even want to leave my room to avoid her fanatic hounding.
 * Got a part time job which basically puts my degree to no use. Also generally work graveyard hours, but not always so more often than not I barely get any sleep at all.
 * A constantly stiff neck and upper back area caused by stress that has lead to very painful, frequent headaches
 * Basically having to go to graduate school in order to pursue a profession with my college major, but doing so would require me to accumulate even more student loan debt
 * Experiencing these same things over and over again and having a general feeling of hopelessness throughout my day, to a point where I just don't want to deal with it anymore. 
 
 I'm just so *tired* and I can't see this getting any better. The idea of suicide has been crossing my mind ever since February in which the start of this snowballing all happened, but as time passed I started leaning more towards it, quietly doing my research while putting on a fake smile every time I had to leave the house and just shutting myself in my room again as soon as I got home. The extent to which I want to avoid my family is so great that I skip meals just so I won't have to see them, because it always ends the same way - with my mother nagging at me and exaggerating the circumstances. I don't have individuals I deem close enough to talk to about my worries either, as my group of closest high school friends is now all over he country busy with their own careers while I feel like I've regressed by moving back home after university and getting a part time job that requires no degree just to start paying my seemingly endless amount of loans back. I did want to further my education, but the prospect of having to borrow even more money is greatly deterring, along with my university GPA being severely lackluster because of the way I barely stumbled over the finish line to graduate this spring. 
 
 I think I'm at my breaking point. I don't know what to do, and I don't want to tolerate this anymore. I know I'm on the younger end of the spectrum and there's the unknown that's waiting for me or whatever, but honestly I just feel like these burdens are just going to keep following me around no matter what path of life I choose to take, and its exhausting and demotivating having to deal with all this at once. I hate to think of using it as an easy way out, but at this point I really just don't want to deal with the pain, depression, and stress that I have to cycle through every moment of my day.",suicide

1538,"Why are people so quick to jump on the pro-life wagon every time someone mentions suicide?First response anytime suicide is mentioned is ""call a crisis line"" or ""get help"" or etc. What really is so bad about taking one's life, aside from potentially hurting family/friends (if you even have any)?
 
 Personally, suicidal thoughts are the only thing that get me through the week. I think to myself that I'll do it Saturday night and I just bide my time till then. It makes me feel relieved inside to think about not having to deal with anything anymore. Only thing stopping is me is being scared of actually doing it. But as each weekend goes by, I get closer to overcoming the fear.
 
 So why can't other people, especially strangers, give their blessing when someone expresses their wish to die rather than try and talk them out of it right away?",suicide
